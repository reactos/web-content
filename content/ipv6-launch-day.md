<p>The foundation of the internet are IP addresses, which tell people how to reach websites and machines across the world. The current iteration, IPv4, is 32bits in size and the world is quickly running out of available addresses. As such, there has been a steady march towards IPv6, which uses 128bits for addresses. This march has however been slow due to the massive existing infrastructure that uses IPv4. To try and help get more organizations IPv6 ready, the Internet Society set up <a href="http://www.worldipv6launch.org/">IPv6 Launch Day</a>, intended to be a day where participating organizations permanently turn on access over IPv6 to their services. As mentioned in <a href="../en/newsletter_92.html">issue 92</a> of the newsletter, the ReactOS Project is a participating organization. Pierre Schweitzer, one of the system administrators of the ReactOS IT infrastructure, has reported that all needed work was done to ensure the project fulfilled the goal laid out by the IPv6 Launch Day. As such, users and developers will be able to access ReactOS sites and services using IPv6 addresses. IPv6 support for ReactOS itself will be a much more difficult effort.</p>
