This guide is intended to help new developers setup and familiarize themselves with the tools needed to obtain, compile, and work with the ReactOS source code, along with a few tips and best practices for the required tools if new developers are unsure what is the best approach to use. This guide does not provide a walkthrough of the ReactOS code base nor does it present an introduction to the NT architecture.
