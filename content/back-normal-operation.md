<h2>Server maintenance</h2>

<p>Our scheduled server maintenance period is over now, all went good and is supposed to be in a working state. If you notice some unusual behavior, please don't hesitate to let us know!</p>
<p>As a bonus, the subversion server was upgraded to the latest stable version, both svn:// and http:// access methods are provided, there is a special dedicated server for per-revision installation CDs storage, and even more bandwidth and server power to the ReactOS Website.</p>
