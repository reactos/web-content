<p>Dear all, You are still numerous people to use our infrastructure without any encryption.</p><p>This news is the opportunity to inform you that the ReactOS infrastructure is fully available with encryption. Web sites (be them developpers or general purpose websites) are finally all HTTPS aware. Other services such as mails are also using secure protocols (SSMTP, SIMAP, and so on). Furthermore, for more security, we enabled HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security) &amp; PFS (Perfect Forward Secrecy). This is to offer you the best protection possible when you browse our infrastructure and use your credentials. </p><p>Given the work done, we also took the opportunty to join the Reset the Net mouvement. This video describes their work: <iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="//www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/qKk8MHFLNNE?rel=0" width="560"></iframe></p><p>We hope you will enjoy this secrecy possibilties.</p><p>Pierre Schweitzer, on behalf of the sysadmin team</p>
