<p>
The ReactOS project is once again taking part in the Sourceforge Community Choice Awards and we have made it into the final round of voting.  ReactOS is currently in three categories, Best Project, Best Project for Government, and Most Likely to Change the Way You Do Everything.  We ask all of our supporters to please vote for us by following this <a href="http://sf.net/community/cca09/vote/?f=431">link</a> and to help spread the word.  There's no money involved, but the publicity would certainly help the project gain more exposure.  In addition, Victor Martinez edited a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pq4T-boHwOQ">video</a>  with several of the ReactOS developers explaining the project and showing off a few antics for the competition and is a very entertaining watch.  So get out there and vote!
