<h2>Versioning</h2><p>The question of changing the versioning scheme was brought up again by and Victor Martinez and Ziliang Guo. Objections came in principally two forms from developers, the first that none of them saw a reason for changing and the other that attempting to use a new scheme based on progress of components was futile as developers work on components at their whim and thus progress cannot be scheduled. Aleksey Bragin again attempted to push developers to make further use of JIRA to track development and thus perhaps set the stage for resolving the question of development progress. Victor and Ziliang tried repeatedly to explain that at present the entire versioning scheme is irrelevant to the developers and thus changing the versioning scheme does not affect them if the change does not attempt to impose a development schedule. A substantial number of developers appeared either unwilling or unable to understand this explanation and by extension brushed off the problematic image the current slow pace of versioning produces. As a consequence, the discussion ended in complete deadlock. Aleksey eventually ended the discussion to move the meeting onto other matters.</p><h2>Paid Review</h2><p>Ziliang raised the issue of perhaps setting up a bounty system to speed up review of patches in Jira. The principal objection came from Pierre Schweitzer who felt it was unfair that developers would be paid to only review whereas the people that actually wrote the patch would not be. Pierre also raised the question of people attempting to game the system, to which Ziliang pointed out that patch reviews and commits would be tracked and if Pierre did not consider this to be sufficient, there was nothing else that could be said to sway him. Timo Kreuzer proposed splitting the payment or even a paid mentorship. Ziliang however pointed out that mentorships have simply not seen any meaningful uptake. The proposal was ultimately rejected due to the inability to reach a compromise regarding abuse concerns and the unwillingness to overrule those concerns.</p><h2>UDF Driver</h2><p>Alexander Rechitskiy reported that he had convinced the UniATA driver developer to open source his UDF IFS driver for Windows and proposed it be included by default in ReactOS. Objections arose in that some felt UDF was not a core functionality and could be kept separate, while others felt the added convenience of the support was sufficiant to warrant its inclusion. A vote was taken and the proposal to include it in ReactOS by default after testing was passed.</p>
