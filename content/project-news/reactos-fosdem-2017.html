<p>The ReactOS project will be attending FOSDEM 2017 in Brussels, on Feburary 4th and 5th. The team will be represented by Colin Finck and Hermès BÉLUSCA-MAÏTO in the K Building, manning a joint booth with Adrien Destugues and François Revol from the <a href="https://www.haiku-os.org/">HaikuOS</a> project, which ReactOS has long had amicable relations with. Be sure to drop by and say hello to the gang, grab some CDs, and if the stars align play a few games.</p>
