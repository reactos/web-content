<h2>Donators page is back on track</h2>

<p>As of today, the <a href="[#link_foundation_donators]">Donators page</a> which lists all monetary donations to the project is back on track.</p>

<p>The long outage originated from the fact that all donations are handled by the German non-profit organization <a href="http://ev.reactos.org">ReactOS Deutschland e.V.</a> as of 2010. This change has required a new software for creating the donation list, which has needed some time to mature.<br />
Gladly, this long development time has paid off and updating the donation list is now just a matter of a few clicks.</p>

<p>We like to use this situation to thank all donors for their help in keeping the ReactOS Project and Infrastructure running!</p>
