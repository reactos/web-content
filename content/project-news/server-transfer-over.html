<h2>Servers are finally migrated to new places!</h2>
<p>The ReactOS server is finally fully migrated now to a new datacenter and new hardware, including mailing lists, webserver with<br/>
all its contents, SVN server, etc.</p>
<p>We had to change really a lot of stuff, to make future transfers easier, to prevent&nbsp;&quot;slashdotting&quot; and thus some of you<br/>
experienced problems using the website or services during the transfer period. I am very pleased to announce that now<br/>
everything is in place and is expected to work as it always did.</p>
<p><br/>
There is a note however, for translators and admins, the static webpages are cached now and are<br/>
automatically updated every 2 hours. So a change in the static webpage can take as much as 2 hours before it goes &quot;live&quot;.</p>

<p><em>Credits</em></p>
<p>I would like to say&nbsp;<strong>Thanks</strong> to Ge van Geldorp, who hosted ReactOS website and mailing lists for years. He did perfect job<br/>
in tuning the server, keeping it up all the times, updating us on planned outages. It's hard to find a person who is as responsible<br/>
Ge is.</p>
<p>And certainly, thanks goes to&nbsp;people who <strong>greatly</strong> helped&nbsp;with moving the old server, setup a new one (even more than one). The work<br/>
on &quot;hot-transferring&quot; the server is incredible and rather unique, and&nbsp;despite it was time-consuming, it was cool.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>With the best regards,<br/>
Aleksey Bragin<br/>
ReactOS Project Coordinator</em></p>
