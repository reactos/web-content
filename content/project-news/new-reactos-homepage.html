<h2>New ReactOS Homepage is online!</h2>
<p>The new ReactOS homepage is now (2005-09-29) online!</p>
<p>The website moved to www.reactos.org as the primary name, with www.reactos.com being an alias (you'll be redirected automatically to www.reactos.org if you use the old name).</p>

<p>The mailing lists are also going to be moved from reactos.com to
reactos.org, so if you have filtering in place please take this into
account.</p>

<p>Many thanks to Ge van Geldorp, Michael Wirth and especially Klemens Friedl who put a lot of effort in the new site.

The ReactOS Web Team.</p>
