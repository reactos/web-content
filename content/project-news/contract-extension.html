<p>The ReactOS Project is happy to announce an extension to Edijs Kolesnikovics's contract for developing application tests using AutoHotkey. Amine Khaldi, the supervisor for the previous contract, was very satisfied with Edijs' work and moved that an extension be made to give Edijs more time to develop additional tests. The first contract saw tests for installing applications and the exercising of some very basic functionality, as well as some improvements to the testing framework. The extension will see Edijs add additional tests for applications that are tested as part of the usual release ramp up and, time permitting, applications on the Golden Apps list as well.</p>
<h2>Contract Details<br /></h2>
<p>Time: 84 hours minimum<br />Wage: &euro;168<br />Expected Duration: 1 month</p>
<p>Objective: Within the designated time period, develop as many AHK test scripts for applications to be used with the automated regression testing as possible.

As time permits, additional tests will be added for ones on the Golden Apps list.</p>
