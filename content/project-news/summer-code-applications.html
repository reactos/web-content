<h2>Summer Of Code: Winning applications for ReactOS project</h2>
<p>It's time to announce the results of the first phase of Google Summer Of Code project.<br/>
Some statistics: ReactOS has&nbsp;got&nbsp;4 slots (our&nbsp;number desired projects was 12), and got around ~30 applications (plus 4 applications were classified as ineligible, and 2 more has been redirected to Google).</p>
<p>Results:</p>
<ul>
    <li>ReactOS Print Spooler Service (spoolsv) by Peter Windridge, mentored by Alex Ionescu.</li>
    <li>Remote Desktop Client application &amp; ActiveX control by Michele Cicciotti, mentored by Alex Ionescu</li>
    <li>Login System by Justin Haygood, mentored by Thomas Weidenmueller</li>
    <li>Clipboard Server API implementation by Pablo Borobia, mentored by Thomas Weidenmueller</li>
</ul>
<p>I congratulate the winning students, they did a great job at picking up complex, but interesting and needed topics, and providing applications, which showed they are capable of performing these tasks.<br/>
However,&nbsp;students who were rejected shouldn't feel like loosers, their apps were&nbsp;great too (we could take 8 more apps), but this time we&nbsp;weren't given them&nbsp;since there are other orgs which need slots too. I would&nbsp;highly appreciate if some of the &quot;rejected&quot; students would consider implementing his stuff even without sponsorship (possibly aiming at SoC 2007).</p>
<p>And, I want to thank Alex Ionescu for picking up the most of administrative work from me, participating in SoC administrators mailing list, and&nbsp;Thomas Weidenmueller, Filip Navara and Magnus Olsen for ranking applications and their will to be mentors.</p>
<p>Certainly, the big thanks goes to Google for making it possible, and for accepting ReactOS in SoC!</p>
