<h2>FOSDEM 2007 event in Brussels</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.fosdem.org">FOSDEM</a>&nbsp;turned out to be a big great event indeed.</p>
<font size="2">
<p>I was just back from the event yesterday, and after having some rest <font face="Courier New" size="2">I'm </font><font size="2">writing this news.
<p>This was my first time attending FOSDEM, and first time speaking at FOSDEM. I should say, FOSDEM's staff organized everything very well, the room<font face="Courier New" size="2"> (Janson)</font><font size="2"> given for ReactOS talk was huge (and the space was not wasted ;)), the hotel was quite perfect and very well situated (despite it's far from the ULB, where the event took place, they provided a nice Taxi service).</font></p>
</font></p>

</font><font face="Courier New" size="2">
<p><font face="Verdana">The talk itself went rather good (video is available, slides will be available from our repository too), I could put all topics I wanted to tell about into the schedule, do the demo of ReactOS and FreeLdr and still have a bit of time for the Q&amp;A section (unfortunately the acoustic properties of the room were against me, so I had to go to almost everyone who was asking a question).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">I recommend you watch <a href="http://fosdem.org/2007/media/video">videos</a>, <a href="ftp://teknoskand.dyndns.org/ReactOS/FOSDEM2007-ReactOS.ogg">mirror01</a> , and <a href="http://www.fosdem.org/2007/media/pictures">pics</a> are also available (I put some pics too to flickr, tagged as fosdem2007).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">I met a few interesting people there, who I knew only by email or did not know at all previously:</font></p>
<ul>
    <li><font face="Verdana">Hussein - thanks for coming!</font> </li>
    <li><font face="Verdana">Christophe &amp; all FOSDEM staff - it was nice to finally see you personally after chatting via email</font> </li>
    <li><font face="Verdana">Alexei - I'll keep in touch with you!</font> </li>
    <li><font face="Verdana">LinuxBIOS (Ronald - sorry I couldn't make it to the speakers dinner to speak with you&nbsp;- will chat via email)</font> </li>
</ul>
<p><font face="Verdana"><em>Some words about the country (my opinion)<br/>
</em></font><font face="Verdana">Belgium turned out to feel different (from other european countries I visited), and reminded me Sweden a bit. Brussel is an interesting city, with a &quot;circular&quot; road architecture, just like Moscow. I could look up almost all sightseeings, and then took a car ride to Antwerpen, and then finally went to Zaventem to kill some time before the flight.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Thanks to everyone who visited the event!</font></p>
