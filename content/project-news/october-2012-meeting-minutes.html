<p>Point 1</p>
<p>People with outstanding contracts were asked to report their progress. There are currently four contracts outstanding for Mike Nordell, Magnus Olsen, Edijs Kolesnikovics, and James Tabor. Edijs is on his third contract extension after completing his second. Ziliang Guo reported that the second contract's report will be published but had been delayed due to Amine Khaldi being away. Mike has also been out of contact and there is concern whether his contract will be completed or not.</p>
<p>James Tabor reported that he is making good progress but is currently dealing with a crashing test with the Opera download. He expects to hack around it if need be before progressing.  Magnus' contract involves attempting to sanitize Samba's build so that it can actually be used as a component in ReactOS or on Windows in general. Samba has its own custom build system which requires about a day to set up, assuming no problems are encountered along the way. Magnus was not in attendance but Jan Kinander reported that he was making progress and hoped to have a cygwin port in three weeks time.</p>
<p>Ziliang pointed out there was a need to systematize how contracts were published, as Edijs' latest extension had not been publicly announced. Magnus' contract was more of a special case as he was initially doing a feasibility check. Now that Magnus believes the work is doable, a formal contract needs to be drafted and published.</p>
<p>Point 2</p>
<p>Colin Finck proposed setting up a voice chat server for internal usage, allowing ReactOS developers and testers to talk to each other instead of merely chatting via IRC. Colin proposed using mumble, though Alexander Rechitskiy suggested Microsoft Lync as an alternative due to its support for video conferencing. Concerns were raised about licensing and so mumble remains the current test choice.</p>
