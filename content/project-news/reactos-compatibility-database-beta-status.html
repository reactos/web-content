<h2>ReactOS Compatibility Database (beta status)</h2>
<p>The ReactOS Compatibility Database has reached beta status.</p>
<p>URL: <b><a href="http://www.reactos.org/support/">http://www.reactos.org/support/</a></b> </p>
<p>The compatibility database has been designed to store application and driver data. Simply click on one of the 5 green start buttons on the frontpage to begin to browse through the database. To submit an application/driver, click on &quot;Submit Application&quot; (menu bar).</p>
<p>Please have a look at the help and faq section for more information.</p>
<p>The goal of the whole compatibility database is to provide one single unified place where a lot of compatibility data can be found.</p>
<p>This has several advantages:</p>
<ul>
    <li>For user it is easy to find out which software does already work in ReactOS and how good it work. </li>
    <li>Everyone (with a myReactOS account) can submit applications/drivers, additional information, vendor data, compatbility test reports, screenshots and post &quot;compatibility forum&quot; entries. In the last few months, several people asked how they could help in the ReactOS project. Now there is a way for people who don't know programming languages, etc., they can now submit their testing results to one place, the compatibility database. Note, in the compatibility database there is a link to the bugzilla related page. </li>
    <li>From now on it will be easier for developers to check regression data, etc. </li>
</ul>
<p>There might be some glitches and bugs, if you find some please post a bugzilla bug entry, write a forum entry or write a reply here (mailing list).</p>
<p>If someone has suggestions and/or ideas how to improve the compatibility database please write a reply, thx.</p>
