<p>As you may know ReactOS, during this year, has been already shown in Belgium, Germany and Spain in several open source events. We're always looking forward to be part of new events and reach new countries.</p>
<p> ReactOS has been selected by the <a href="http://www.opensourcelisbon.com" target="_blank">Open Source Lisbon</a> organization to be part of their event on 28th September. An amazing opportunity to reach a new country ( this is our first time ever in Portugal ) from the hand of the biggest open source FREE event in <b>Portugal</b>. </p>
