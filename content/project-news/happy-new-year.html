<h2>Happy New Year!</h2>
<p>2005 was a great year for ReactOS.</p>
<p>The following facts came from the SVN server (thanks to Casper Hornstrup):</p>
<ul>
<li>The core ReactOS code base is now 120MB large.</li>
<li>The repository is currently 624MB large and contains ~20500 revisions.</li>
<li>~8000 of these revisions were created in 2005.</li>
<li>This mean 39% of the total number of revisions created during ReactOS' entire 8 year history was created in 2005!</li>
</ul>
<p>ReactOS Website facts:</p>
<ul>
<li>The ReactOS website is available in 8 different languages.</li>
<li>This means 1296 static (x)html pages and several server side scripts.</li>
</ul>
<p>We hope that we will see similar growth (if not more) in 2006.</p>
<p><b>Keep up the good work!</b></p>
