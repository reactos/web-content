<p>After five years the ReactOS Project is returning to the <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/organizations/6324900541235200/">Google Summer of Code</a>. On the heels of the 0.4.0 release the project's aim is on creating smoother user experiences and generally making the system feel more robust and pleasant to use. <span>The team is looking for students interested in learning more about the NT architecture that underpins the most widely used desktop operating system in the world and who wants to take part in the creation of an open source implementation of it. <span>Head on over to the <a href="https://www.reactos.org/wiki/Google_Summer_of_Code_2016_Ideas">project proposal page</a> to see some of the ideas we've come up with so far. If you have your own bright idea on how to make ReactOS even better don't be afraid to share as we're always open to new ideas. Either way head over to the <a href="https://reactos.org/irc">IRC channel</a> to give us a shout if you're interested. We promise, we don't bite. Most of the time.</span></span></p>
