<p>For a over a year we've been working hard on the ReactOS (R)evolution. It is undoubtedly the largest initiative from the ReactOS Foundation so far in terms of Strategy and Evolution. When Microsoft started counting down to the end we started counting down to a new beginning.</p><p>Big changes are coming, while you will find some of them desired and expected thanks to your feedback and support, you'll also be greatly surprised by some others: It's time to move ReactOS to the Next Level.</p><p>The <a href="http://community.reactos.org">(R)evolution</a> has begun, and without a doubt it will rise all kinds of interesting debates out there. We come prepared and we need your push. When the clock hits zero we will show the world our (R)evolution.</p><p>We shouldn't reveal more details. Let the others "suffer" ;). But all the hard work is now done. We just ask you to embrace, promote and share the <a href="http://community.reactos.org">(R)evolution.</a> It takes a minute for your time, but could be the needed inertia to make this (R)evolution, your (R)evolution, a success.</p>
