<p>2013-05-30<br />19:00 UTC<br />dev.reactos.org, #meeting</p><h2>Proceedings</h2><p>Meeting started at 19:11 by Aleksey Bragin.</p><ul><li>Point 1: Contracts</li><li>Point 2: Release</li></ul><h2>Point 1</h2><p>Colin Finck reported that Matthias Kupfer had another meeting with tax advisers to try to resolve the issue of direct funding. Ziliang Guo prodded Aleksey Bragin again to remind him that the Russian ReactOS Foundation needed to start issuing invoices to cover existing contracts. A suggestion was made to hire freelancers to help develop the project, but there was internal resistance to this as traditionally open source projects do not fund development commercially like that unless under extraordinary circumstances. One alternative proposal was to set up a mini-GSoC with the current funds, though the stipends would be nowhere as generous.</p><h2>Point 2</h2><p>Aleksey asked when the next release should be scheduled. Ziliang offered a schedule of one month for 0.3.16, though Victor Martinez pushed hard for a 0.4.0 release. Ziliang&#39;s primary objection was that after having established goals for 0.4.0, there was no chance of those goals being fulfilled in a month&#39;s time. Victor countered that he regarded the goals as largely met, a view not shared by Ziliang. Victor&#39;s argument was rooted in the fact that the current state of trunk was vastly superior to 0.3.0 thereby justifying a version bump. Ziliang did not regard this point as sufficient to warrant outright missing several of the stated objectives for 0.4.0. The discussion was ultimately deferred for Victor and Ziliang to work out some sort of compromise with respect to release scheduling and versioning.</p><p>Meeting was closed at 21:14 by Aleksey Bragin.</p><p>Minutes prepared by Ziliang Guo.</p>
