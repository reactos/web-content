<h2>ReactOS Fundraising campaign</h2>
<p>A month ago ReactOS project announced a <a href="http://www.reactos.org/en/fundraising_campaign.html">fundraising campaign</a> aimed to gather money to support our operation - servers, exhibitions, promotions, spread the word, etc.</p>
<p>Today I am very glad to say that this fundraising campaign did not only meet the required value of 4000 euro, but also outperformed and we gathered a total of 4450 EUR!</p>
<p>We already ordered parts for the new buildslave server, which is going to be amazingly fast in building DBG/REL .iso's (it's interface is available <a href="http://www.reactos.org:8010">here</a> and resulting iso's are stored <a href="http://svn.reactos.org/iso">here</a>, but have in mind that we are working on it right now, so it might be unavailable). Also, Alex Ionescu already got a compensation for part of his SOCAL travelling expenses (flight). More stuff to come - I will make sure we do our best at informing you how money are spent.</p>
<p>I want to say Thanks A Lot to all <a href="http://www.reactos.org/en/fundraising_campaign_donators.html">people who donated</a>, your support means very much to us.</p>
