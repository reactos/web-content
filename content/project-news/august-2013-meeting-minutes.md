<p>Note that while there was a June meeting, all of the points were internal in nature. As such, there will be no public minutes for that meeting.</p><p>2013-08-29<br />19:00 UTC<br />dev.reactos.org, #meeting</p><h2>Proceedings</h2><p>Meeting started at 19:04 by Aleksey Bragin.</p><ul><li>Point 1: Funded Development Status</li><li>Point 2: Version Scheme</li><li>Point 3: SEO</li><li>Point 4: FOSDEM</li></ul><h2>Point 1</h2><p>Matthias Kupfer reported that revised rules for the German ReactOS Foundation are ready for review. Assuming the tax authorities do not find any new problems, he believes the German ReactOS Foundation will be able to directly issue fellowships for ReactOS developments around the turn of the year.</p><h2>Point 2</h2><p>Aleksey Bragin proposed dropping the current version scheme of X.Y.Z for future releases. No one objected to the proposal. Ziliang Guo suggested an alternative based on month and year of release plus an additional code name to indicate NT compatibility target. After further discussion, it was decided Ziliang and Victor Martinez would hash out some firmer proposals that others can then provide feedback on.</p><h2>Point 3</h2><p>Alexander Rechitskiy proposed a minor tweak to the titles of the site pages to include ReactOS and a short description in them for SEO purposes. Ziliang said he would look into the matter as it would be a highly manual process.</p><h2>Point 4</h2><p>Aleksey was hounded by several other members to remember to apply for FOSDEM. Several developers indicated they would be available to attend and Aleksey promised to do so. Pierre Schweitzer informed Aleksey he would be setting up a cron job to email Aleksey every day to remind him of it.</p><p>Meeting was closed at 20:26 by Aleksey Bragin.</p><p>Minutes prepared by Ziliang Guo.</p>
