<p>We are proud to announce that ReactOS has been accepted into the 2011 Google Summer of Code program. It has been a few years since we were last a part of the program, so we are keen to use this opportunity not only to benefit ReactOS in hopefully gaining new features, but in passing on our knowledge to bright and prospective students with an interest in operating system development and especially Windows internals.</p>
<p>A list of potential projects can be found <a href="../wiki/Google_Summer_of_Code_2011_Ideas">here</a>, though students are by no means restricted to the proposals already listed and are invited to submit their own suggestions. A guide has also been posted <a href="../wiki/Google_Summer_of_Code_2011">here</a> to help students with writing their proposals and provide answers to general questions.&nbsp; The guide also has a list of mentor candidates so students know who to approach for advice about their proposals.</p>
<p>Student candidates are also advised to join the developer mailing list <a href="../mailman/listinfo/ros-dev">here</a> and join the #reactos IRC channel on freenode to interact with developers and potential mentors.  These are the best places to discuss your project ideas and get feedback.</p>
<p>Good luck to anyone submitting and we look forward to hearing from you and hopefully working with you in the near future.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
