<p>The ReactOS Project is proud to announce its participation in <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/organizations/5144807102480384/">Google Summer of Code 2019</a>. The Summer of Code program offers students interested in operating systems the unique opportunity to dive into ReactOS development over the course of 3 months and get paid by Google for completed tasks. ReactOS has successfully participated in Summer of Code multiple times in the past. Completed projects include better filesystem support, an improved Application Manager, and a more stable network stack - just to name a few.</p>
