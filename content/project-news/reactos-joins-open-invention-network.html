<h3>The ReactOS Foundation officially joins the Open Invention Network!</h3>
<blockquote>The Open Invention Network is a shared defensive patent pool with the mission to protect Linux. Launched in 2005, OIN has strong industry support with backing from Google, IBM, NEC, Philips, Red Hat, Sony and SUSE (a business unit of Novell).</blockquote>  

<p>ReactOS is just a small piece in this big opensource world and even if we're not a Linux project, helping to protect the opensource spirit is, and will always be, a must for us. That's the main reason that pushed us to be part of <a href="http://www.openinventionnetwork.com/">OIN</a>.</p>

<p>We know how hard is keeping a project alive, how many white nights an opensource project costs, and how many pitfalls the opensource community is avoiding to keep going on. </p>
<p>J-OIN-ing the open invention network is for us a social debt: The Linux community is made by big companies but, mainly, by tons of small projects created by opensource lovers which wouldn't have any opportunity to counterstrike back in case they are suited. Suites which strangles innovative projects just to protect their private interests.</p>
 
<p>As you know, ReactOS contributes daily to some of these Linux projects with patches and code, but today our small contribution is joining OIN, hoping that this action will help them in the future, but also showing how the communities should tie together in our r34l love for opensource over any flags and signs.</p>
