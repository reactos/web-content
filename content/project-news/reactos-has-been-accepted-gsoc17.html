<p>The ReactOS Team is proud to announce that Google has once again selected the ReactOS project to be part in the upcoming 2017 Google Summer of Code.</p>
<p>This is the first time ReactOS has been accepted for<b> GSOC two years consecutively</b>, setting an important landmark in ReactOS’ history. No doubt the amazing work of the ReactOS mentors and students in the 2016 program contributed to make this possible.</p>
<p>The GSOC program is a great opportunity to join recognized and skilled mentors with eager and skilled students alike. It’s an opportunity to enhance your skills with the NT architecture, to join an international team of developers, to contribute to the opensource ecosystem, and finally, to open doors to new job opportunities both within ReactOS and in the greater industry. Last year ReactOS offered part time scholarships to its students after GSOC was done, and we’re hoping to present the same opportunity again this year.</p>
<p>So it's time again for a <b>"Call for Students"</b>: If you feel attracted by the ReactOS objectives, or if you know someone who would love to be one of our students for GSOC'17, feel free to <a href="https:///summerofcode.withgoogle.com/organizations/5423529534160896">visit our GSOC page</a> and view our idea list for this year.  ReactOS students have described this experience as <b>"unique and immersive"</b> and has allowed them to “boost their coding skills new levels". So don't miss this new chance!</p>
 

<h2> ReactOS GSOC 2016</h2> 
<p> ReactOS was present in GSOC 2016 with fantastic results. Last year, Alex Ionescu, Aleksey Bragin, Thomas Faber, Ged Murphy, Pierre Schweitzer, Art Yerkes and Amine Khaldi were mentoring GSOC'16. 
Thanks to their students work, the USB stack was improved, an NTFS native driver was created, a win32 network driver was reworked, and AHCI support was added. ReactOS really wants to thank, once again, both menthors and students for their titanic effort to make those projects successful..</p>

 <h2>About GSOC </h2>
<p> Google Summer of Code is a global program focused on introducing students to open source software development. Students work on a 3 month programming project with an open source organization during their break from university. As a part of Google Summer of Code, student participants are paired with a mentor from the participating organizations, gaining exposure to real-world software development and techniques. Students have the opportunity to spend the break between their school semesters earning a stipend while working in areas related to their interests. </p>
