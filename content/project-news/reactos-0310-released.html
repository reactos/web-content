<h2>ReactOS 0.3.10 Released</h2>
<p>The ReactOS team is proud to announce the release of ReactOS 0.3.10.  This version is the first to use the Universal ATA driver as the default disk driver, adding support for Serial ATA and partitions greater than 8GB.  In addition, recent work was done on the USB stack to increase compatibility with USB keyboards and mice.  These features are still under heavy development and have several known bugs, but their inclusion should allow more people to run ReactOS on real hardware and are part of the extensive work to make ReactOS usable as an every day operating system.</p>
<p>Apart from that, ReactOS made it into the final round of the <a href=" https://sourceforge.net/community/cca09/vote/?f=431">SourceForge Community Choice Awards</a>. If you like it, you can vote for us in the categories <i>Best Project</i>, <i>Best Project for Government</i> and <i>Most Likely to Change the Way you Do Everything</i></p>
<p>Along with the rest of the 0.3 series, this release is still considered alpha quality software so it may not run all your apps or run on your hardware.</p>
