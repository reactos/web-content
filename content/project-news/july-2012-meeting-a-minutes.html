</p>
<h2>Point 0</h2>
<p>Ziliang Guo presented the question of CD sales and merchendise sales in general. Amine Khaldi updated the team on the work he and others have done to get storefronts up and going. The primary concern was a lack of decent designs for the stores. Ziliang was tasked with contacting graphic artists he knows in the community to see if this can be remedied. The decision of what to do with the promo CDs was left to Ziliang as well.</p>
<h2>Point 1</h2>
<p>Aleksey Bragin stated that he intended to help with Jira integration with the new site, which is necessary as a replacement for bugzilla. He also hopes to help with making the build environment more user friendly.</p>
<p>Olaf Siejka reported on a variety of regressions in freeldr and the win32 subsystem that he wants fixed as they are blocking further\ development and testing. Other developers asked for specific reports to be assigned to them and reviewed whether they thought they knew the cause of regressions.</p>
<p>Collaboration with the UniATA developer was also discussed, with reports that upstream patches have been accepted and suggestions on further work that can be done.</p>
<h2>Point 2</h2>
<p>Danny Gotte was not present so this point was skipped.</p>
<h2>Point 3</h2>
<p>Pierre Schweitzer presented the <a href="http://www.internetdeclaration.org/freedom">Internet Declaration</a>, a statement of beliefs drafted by various groups that wish the internet to remain free of<br />censorship and ensure user privacy. Many other organizations have signed onto it and Pierre asked whether the ReactOS Foundation should also do so. This was put to a vote and passed with overwhelming support.</p>
<h2>Other Decisions</h2>
<p>Ziliang requested that all developers be added onto the public relations mailing list. This was approved.</p>
<p>Meeting was closed at 20:38 by Aleksey Bragin<br />Minutes were prepared by Ziliang Guo</p>
