<p>The ReactOS Project is proud to announce the first of the development&nbsp;contracts that will be funded by the recent donation campaign. Edijs&nbsp;Kolesnikovics joined the ReactOS development team very recently and&nbsp;has been working extensively with Amine Khaldi and Olaf Siejka to&nbsp;create an application test suite based around the AutoHotkey (AHK)&nbsp;automation system. AutoHotkey is a tool for scripting keyboard and&nbsp;mouse actions in order to automate running of programs on Windows.&nbsp;While the current test suites exercise a considerable amount of&nbsp;functionality, the true test for ReactOS remains when it is used to&nbsp;run applications. As such, Edijs has been working to create tests&nbsp;using AHK to run a variety of applications, starting with those on the&nbsp;<a href="../wiki/Testing_Central#GOLDENAPPS">Golden Apps</a> list. The basic framework is already in place along with a&nbsp;few tests, but much more can be done to expand the selection of&nbsp;applications tested. As such, the Foundation has elected to grant&nbsp;Edijs a development contract to develop additional tests. The project&nbsp;congratulates Edijs on a job well done so far, and would also like to&nbsp;thank Amine, Olaf, and the AHK developers for their help mentoring and&nbsp;advising Edijs.</p>
<h2>Contract Details</h2>
<p>Time: 84 hours minimum<br />Wage: &euro;168<br />Expected Duration: 1 month</p>
<p>Objective: Within the designated time period, develop as many AHK test&nbsp;scripts for applications to be used with the automated regression&nbsp;testing as possible. The intended goal is to have at least all&nbsp;remaining Golden Apps testable. This project seeks to help developers&nbsp;catch regressions more quickly so that stabilizing ReactOS for&nbsp;releases becomes less time consuming. This task will be monitored by&nbsp;Amine Khaldi.</p>
<p>Sidenote: Due to a variety of circumstances unrelated to the donation campaign, Edijs' contract wage is significantly lower than what would be the standard contract wage for the project.</p>
