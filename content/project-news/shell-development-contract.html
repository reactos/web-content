<p>The Foundation for the Advancement of Information Technologies ReactOS Foundation (Russia) is pleased to announce a development contract with Giannis Adamopoulos. The contract will involve extending the shell32 library to support running the explorer-new shell. Focus will be on the browseui components, needed to allow explorer-new to display its file browser. This is the first step to ultimately replacing the existing explorer shell.
