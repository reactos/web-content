<h2>ReactOS 0.3.6 Released</h2>
<p>
In a little over a month since version 0.3.5, we are announcing the release ReactOS 0.3.6.
</p>
<p>
This release along with the rest of the 0.3.x series is still considered alpha quality software, so do not set your expectations too high.
</p>
<p>
ReactOS 0.3.6 is the product of the current development focus: bugfixes, compatibility, and stability. There were more than a thousand commits to the ReactOS Subversion repository this month.
</p>
<h3>Changes summary</h3>A consolidation of all changes in great details can be found in the <a href="../wiki/index.php/ChangeLog-0.3.6">changelog</a>. Summing up the most important changes:
