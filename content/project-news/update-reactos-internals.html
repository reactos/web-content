<h2>Update on ReactOS internals</h2>
<p><strong>0.3.2 Release</strong><br/>
<br/>
ReactOS 0.3.2 is officially going to be skipped (due to 4 blocker bugs), and ReactOS 0.3.3 will be the next in the cycle which, according to the 2 months release schedule,&nbsp;will be released in July. Trunk already has many improvements and bugfixes for 0.3.3, however we are still working on fixing those 4 major issues.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Team</strong><br/>
<br/>
<a href="http://www.alex-ionescu.com/">Alex Ionescu</a> left the ReactOS team to follow an exciting career opportunity working with <a href="http://www.solsem.com/">David Solomon</a> as an official replacement to&nbsp;<a href="http://blogs.technet.com/markrussinovich/default.aspx">Mark Russinovich</a><br/>
Our best wishes to him at his new position, and a big thanks for all the great work he has done for ReactOS. <br/>
<br/>
On a another note, Daniel Reimer and Colin Finck have been granted write-access to the <a href="http://svn.reactos.org/svn/reactos">SVN repository</a>. Daniel will be working on RosBE and Colin will be working on web related stuff assisting Klemens Friedl. Some of the changes can be seen already &ndash; the <a href="http://www.reactos.org/wiki">ReactOS Wiki</a> has been upgraded to the latest version, and a new release of RosBE is already scheduled.<br/>
