<p>In order to fix the availability problems of our Website, the ReactOS Infrastructure Team will upgrade another Server on <strong>28th December</strong>.</p><p>This will result in a downtime for the following public services:</p><ul><li><a href="http://www.reactos.org">www.reactos.org</a> Website</li><li><a href="http://jira.reactos.org">jira.reactos.org</a> Bugtracker</li><li><a href="http://reactos.reactos.org">reactos.reactos.org</a> Test Server</li></ul><p>SVN will continue to function, as well as our Build and Test bots. The latest ReactOS builds can be downloaded at <a href="http://iso.reactos.org">iso.reactos.org</a> in the meantime.</p><p>After the upgrade, you should be able to enjoy a higher availability and faster response times when using the ReactOS Online Services. Additionally, it paves the way for porting the last missing services from the old website (such as the Compatibility Database or People Map).</p><p>We will keep you updated and apologize for the inconveniences.</p>
