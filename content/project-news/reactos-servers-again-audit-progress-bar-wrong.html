<p>One of ReactOS server machines (which serves DNS, SVN and website proxy)&nbsp;went&nbsp;offline due to a problem with the webhosting. Now all services&nbsp;are up again except for SVN which is temporarily offline for moving to another machine (expected to be finished today).&nbsp;<br/>
Sorry for any inconvenience you might have experienced.</p>
<p>The audit is not complete, the progress bar is wrong because of the server downtime.</p>
