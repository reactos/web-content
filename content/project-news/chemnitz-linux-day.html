<p>Several German members of the ReactOS development team and Aleksey Bragin, the project coordinator, will be attending the Chemnitz Linux Day, an expo for open source technologies running from March 13 to 14. Besides the team manning a table, Matthias Kupfer will be holding a talk outlining the architecture of ReactOS as well as achieved and future objectives on Sunday, March 14 at 16:30, so be sure to drop by. The event will also be the first time the German ReactOS Association makes its public appearance, with the majority of the board present. As usual, the team will also be giving out themed ReactOS CDs for the event. We hope to see many of you there!</p>
