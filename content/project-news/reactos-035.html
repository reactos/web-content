<h2>ReactOS 0.3.5 Released</h2>
<p>
Four months after the release of 0.3.4, we are pleased to announce ReactOS 0.3.5. 
</p>
<p>
This release, along with the rest of the 0.3.x series is still considered alpha quality software, so do not set your expectations too high. 
</p>
<p>
ReactOS 0.3.5 release contains fixes for many old bugs, some having been present since 0.3 or even earlier and some being regressions introduced in further releases due to rewrites of certain components, not to mention new features. 
</p>
<h3>Changes summary</h3>A consolidation of all changes in great details can be found in the <a href="../wiki/index.php/ChangeLog-0.3.5">changelog</a>. Summing up the most important changes:: 
<ul>
