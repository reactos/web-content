<p>Open source is more than just individual bits of software in isolation, it is about the ecosystem and environment that those bits of software come together to create. To that end, as part of the <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/reactos-community-edition">Community Edition</a> initiative the ReactOS Project has put together the <a href="http://community.reactos.org/index.php/support/programs/opensource-development-program">Open Source Support Program</a> to help its end users in building that environment. When a user installs a new operating system, one of the first things they need to do is go and install all of the applications that they actually need. It would be far more convenient however if a user could have all of their applications ready to go out the gate. The Open Source Support program is designed to achieve that convenience. Participating applications will be supported in the Setup App Manager, which allows software to be pre-staged in an installation image. In addition, extra attention will be paid to ensure that participating applications remain in a working state and regressions are kept to a minimum. The service is free to all software under a free or open source license and is intended to help provide wider audiences to such programs.</p><p>Interested parties can refer to this <a href="http://community.reactos.org/index.php/support/programs/opensource-development-program">page</a> for more information or contact us directly at the pr@reactos.org address.</p>
