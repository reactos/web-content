<p>Computer Aided Design software has long been the bastion of proprietary vendors such as Autodesk and SolidWorks where license seats tend to run into the thousands of dollars, putting them well out of reach of enthusiasts and hobbyists. It has only been recently that software for design work has become more accessible and in many ways this accessibility has helped spawn the entire Maker revolution that is happening now.<br /> The ReactOS Project is therefore very pleased to see <a href="http://librecad.org">LibreCAD</a> join as the first member of the Open Source Support Program. As projects that both seek to make our respective fields more accessible, the ReactOS Project looks forward to a long and beneficial partnership.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://community.reactos.org/index.php/support/programs/opensource-development-program">Open Source Support Program</a> is open to all software projects that use a free or open source license. Participating programs will see special attention paid to them to ensure continued compatibility in ReactOS.<br /> Interested parties can contact the project at the pr@reactos.org address.</p><p><a href="http://blog.librecad.org/2014/05/librecad-on-reactos/"><img alt="Image" class="imgp_img" src="/sites/default/files/imagepicker/4801/ReactOS_[Running]-20140519-124642.jpg" height="508" width="640" /><br />http://blog.librecad.org/2014/05/librecad-on-reactos</a></p>
