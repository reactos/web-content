<h2>New RosCMS v3 online</h2>
<p>The ReactOS Content Management System software for the ReactOS website got a major update. RosCMS is used to manage the ReactOS website and in near future additionally to maintain the ReactOS translation work. It is a very flexible web based system. The core parts of the software are the flexible database layout and the dynamic interface that consist of a bunch of filters. The end user can costumize his/her own workflow by changing the filter settings or choose one of the predefined views (which consist itself of filters internally).</p>

<p>Klemens Friedl has worked since march 2007 on RosCMS version 3 which replaced the two year old RosCMS version 2 on 2007-07-31. This major update involves a lot of changes, the whole database structure changed from a simple, partly redundant layout to a very flexible mature database layout. The RosCMS interface moved from simple old-style HTML-forms to what some call AJAX style web-application. The new interface is design to be consistent, simple to use and understand as well as with security in mind.</p>
