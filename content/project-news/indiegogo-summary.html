<p>The final count: 348 credits, 243 votes, 54 Wall of Fame, and $25,141 with over 500 backers from over two dozen countries.</p><p>Even if the funding goal was not met, the response from the community has been phenomenal and we are grateful for all the support, not just in backing the campaign but also in spreading the word. Thanks to the Campaign, ReactOS and the Community Edition has been shown off by countless blogs, open source news feeds, community sites, and personal pages. You can see a collection of them <a href="http://community.reactos.org/index.php/press">here</a> and we will be adding more as we find&nbsp; them. And of course, we want to thank projects that joined the <a href="http://community.reactos.org/index.php/support/programs/opensource-development-program">Open Source Support Program</a>, <a href="http://librecad.org/">LibreCad</a>, <a href="http://peazip.sourceforge.net/">Peazip</a>, <a href="http://preccalc.sourceforge.net/">Precise Calculator</a>, and <a href="http://doublesvsoop.sourceforge.net/">PWCT</a>, and further helped spread the word.</p><p>As mentioned before, not reaching the funding goal does not mean the Community Edition will not happen. On the contrary, we are even now working through the voting process to select three applications and three pieces of hardware for dedicated support. Other rewards are also in the pipeline as we gather addresses and sizes and work with vendors to get them to you as quickly as possible.</p><p>The IndieGoGo campaign was but the first step in the ReactOS Re-evolution and there will be more to come so don't forget to check our feeds both on the site and on Facebook and Twitter.</p>
