<p>A year ago the project ran a donation drive to raise money to pay for funded development of ReactOS. While the drive was moderately successful, a slight paperwork issue with the German foundation caused a temporary halt to funded development contracts. Since then, the issue has been resolved and the project has been working to restart handing out development contracts to demonstrate that the money donated to the project is being put to good use. One such contract given to Giannis Adamopoulos was recently completed and a report is forthcoming detailing the extensive work he did with shell support. This time however the ReactOS Foundation is pleased to announce as a small Christmas present to our supporters and donors the first full time development contract awarded to David Quintana.</p><p>David has been a long time lurker on the ReactOS development IRC channel under the nickname gigaherz, producing a steady stream of patches covering the runtime library and kernel. Upon joining as a full time developer, David's initial task will be helping with the new explorer shell bringup but he will likely eventually be contributing to lower level components such as the kernel.</p><p>Large development contracts such as this one are only possible due to continuing support from the community. While the project has remained quite over the past few months while the legal issues were sorted out, we are now at a point where we can publicly and consistently state that your donations make an active difference in helping ReactOS mature. We hope that the continued support will see ReactOS eventually become a competent and desirable desktop operating system.</p><p>On a final note, thanks should also go to Amine Khaldi for working out the contract arrangements, members of the German ReactOS association for dealing with the legal issues, and of course Aleksey Bragin for issuing the paperwork to see contractors are paid in a timely manner.</p>
