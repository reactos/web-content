<p>The calculator in modern versions of Windows is a very useful tool, but it is still limited in many respects especially when trying to punch in a long computation. Third parties have come up with a variety of alternatives though and it is the Project's great pleasure to present <a href="http://preccalc.sourceforge.net/"><b>Precise Calculator</b></a> as another member of the Open Source Support Program.</p>
<p>Precise Calculator not only has feature parity with the native calculator on Windows, it offers a variety of enhancements such as unit conversions and even the ability to script calculations. The scripting functionality is especially handy simply for existing as a way to punch in equations and being able to fix them directly instead of having to redo everything after a single mistaken enter. The flexibility offered here is sure to please powerusers and anyone who has ever tried to do math homework on the computer. No more need to resort to Wolfram Alpha!</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Precise Calculator" class="imgp_img" src="/sites/default/files/imagepicker/4801/preccalc.png" height="480" width="640"></p>
