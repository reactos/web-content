<h2>The ReactOS team is proud to announce the release of ReactOS 0.3.13.</h2>
<p>This version continues building on the work first previewed in 0.3.12, ranging from memory management improvements to better sound and display control.  A Coverity scan also occurred between 0.3.12 and 0.3.13, helping the team clean up potential security holes and also help improve general stability by enforcing more care in memory operations.</p>
<p>Some of the biggest system changes happened with memory management with the introduction of a new heap manager based on the Windows 2003/Vista architecture, significantly increasing ReactOS’ compatibility with advanced memory allocation types and providing proper kernel mode heap management used by win32k.  Performance should also see a significant boost for many memory operations even without the addition of optimizations on top of the new heap.  The addition of a debug heap manager late in the release cycle also spurred on a series of fixes to memory usage across ReactOS, from the operating system to bundled applications.  These changes should significantly improve system stability, moving ReactOS one step closer to being a viable daily use operating system.</p>
<p>Other improvements include the merging in of work done in the yarotows branch for improved display driver loading and dynamic mode changing, significantly increasing ReactOS’ usability.</p>
<p>During the preparation of this release, 282 bugs were fixed, including 50 regressions with the oldest regression being issue #4811 ("comctl32.dll sync broke Abiword toolbar"). The oldest bug fixed is #1567 "Taskmanager still showing processes while they are closed" (almost 5 years old). 382 new bugs were opened since the release of 0.3.12.</p>
<p>Previous releases 0.3.11 and 0.3.12 were downloaded 238 and 526 thousand times, which totals up to an amazing amount of 764 000 downloads, and a significant increase looks very promising.</p>

<p>Some of the most important changes: </p>
<ul>
<li>Implemented dynamic video mode switch and improved graphics drivers compatibillity.</li>
<li>Fixed several graphic issues.</li>
<li>Completely rewritten heap manager with additional debugging capabilities for detecting out of bounds operations.</li>
<li>Improved management of audio mixer lines, preventing application sounds from becoming garbled due to overlapping lines.</li>
<li>Heavy bug fixing in user subsystem ( improved handling of user mouse input, messages and timers).</li>
<li>Visual artifacts fixed in some apps as Firefox and Thunderbird.</li>
<li>Fixed several bugs in the installer.</li>
<li>Improved apps compatibility: Stellarium 0.10.2, LHelp, winpcap,FlashPlayer 10.1 and Mono 2.8, OllyDbg 1.10, Xenon 2000, VLC 1.1.5, Foobar 2000, Skype 4.0.0 work now.</li>
<li>More SATA devices are supported.</li>
<li>Lots of test cases were fixed.</li>
<li>Many improvements in the memory manager that fix several bugs and make it more compatible with NT memory manager.</li>

</ul>
