<h2>ReactOS Website back online again</h2>
<p>ReactOS website has been offline for two weeks due to a hardware problem. Everything is back online!</p>
<p>The RAID controller inside the server failed and &quot;forgot&quot; all RAID partitions, the reason is unknown. The server hardware and harddisk content has been restored and everything is back online again.</p>
<p>Fixing the problem was not easy during christmas time. Thanks to all persons who have been involved&nbsp;in bringing the webserver back online.</p>
