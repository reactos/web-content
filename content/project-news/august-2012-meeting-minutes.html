<p>Point 0</p>
<p>Ziliang Guo had earlier reported that Atlassian's documentation was misleading with respect to Jira integration and did not actually permit what the team was trying to achieve. This was only discovered after Ziliang submitted a support request to Atlassian. The team then proceeded to discuss alternatives. The primary problem was the desire to preserve the current hashed passwords, which required that the same authentication mechanism be used. Otherwise all users would need to reset their passwords. The current plan is for Danny Gotte and Aleksey Bragin to look into an OpenLDAP server that provides a read-only copy of user accounts synchronized with accounts imported from RosCMS. Once this is set up, testing with Jira can resume as Jira does support using an LDAP server as an authentication mechanism. If this does not work, no further effort will be made to preserve the old passwords as it is one of the primary causes of the delayed website transition.</p>
<p>Point 1</p>
<p>A problem with registry corruption has been observed in VirtualBox, causing issues with testing. This corruption occurs randomly and is suspected to be a filesystem corruption. As a work around, Alex Ionescu had suggested a read-only registry be used for test runs. The trick however is setting this in between boots after ReactOS has been installed. Giannis Adamopoulos volunteered to look into the issue while further discussion took place about how to detect the actual corruption.</p>
<p>Olaf Siejka reported on the work needed to be done in order to test a purely MSVC built ReactOS. These required C++ related fixes, some work to sysreg3 to allow it to receive debug messages from the kernel debugger, and a symbol store that the kernel debugger can use.</p>
<p>Point 2</p>
<p>Amine Khaldi reported that Edijs Kolesnikovics' contract had concluded to his satisfaction and moved that it be extended. Additional contracts from other developers are also in the pipleline but needed some more fleshing out of details before they could be announced.</p>
<p>Point 3</p>
<p>Status on trunk is currently relatively good, except for a few outliers. Firefox 14 is a major one that needs to be fixed before a release could happen. The team proposed doing a series of release candidates to help iron out any bugs. Ziliang and Giannis pointed out that unless the developers maintained discipline and stopped committing major changes into trunk, the results from RCs would be invalidated before they were even reported. The current plan is to try to maintain that discipline.</p>
