<p>The ReactOS Project is pleased another participant in the Open Source Support Program, <a href="http://peazip.sourceforge.net/"><b>PeaZIP</b></a>.</p><p>Many community members have been asking that some sort of <span class="il">zip</span> utility be bundled with ReactOS for convenience and while participation in the program does not mean <i>PeaZIP</i> will be present by default, it will make it considerably easier for users to pre-stage <i>PeaZIP</i> so that it will be available to use once the installation of ReactOS is complete.</p><p><i>PeaZIP</i> supports a wide range of archive formats such as 7Z, RAR, TAR, and of course ZIP, and many more. With that support, users that pre-stage it in ReactOS will likely be able to open basically any archive they ever have a need to.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Image" class="imgp_img" src="/sites/default/files/imagepicker/4801/peazip.png" height="480" width="640"></p>
