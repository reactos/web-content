<p>Right before Christmas, Aleksey Bragin and Steven Edwards launched the <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/thorium/thorium-core-cloud-desktop">Thorium Core Kickstarter </a>appeal. At its most basic level, the goal is to advance ReactOS development by creating a commercial project using it. The proposed product, as it were, is a remotely accessible desktop environment, basically a computer in the cloud. No longer does one need to shuffle around USB sticks or reinstall applications from computer to computer, simply connect to Thorium and you'll be back to your familiar setup.</p><p>The question for this community is of course what does Thorium mean for ReactOS? Well, for one a successful Kickstarter would provide a significant infusion of funds that can be used to develop ReactOS. For another, a successful launch of Thorium would provide an ongoing revenue stream to continue funding development. Another key point is everything that goes into Thorium will get fed back into ReactOS, helping make the operating system better, more compatible, and more stable. There has always been talk about how ReactOS could be applied commercially by other companies. Perhaps it's time to lead the way by showing it can be done via Thorium.</p>
