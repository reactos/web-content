<p>Sorry for the delay! Drupal was causing issues on submitting new things.</p><p>This week I continued what I was doing the previous one.</p><p>I focused my efforts in the browse window, tweaking the existing code, fixing logic issues and cleaning up the code a bit.</p><p>There were some visual differences that were easy to fix, and others that will require a lot of work.</p><p>I added some code to extract the icon and show it in the titlebar. I fixed the window style of the rebar, so that it shows the border around the toolbars. I fixed the size calculation for the bars, which worked mostly in Windows 2003, but it was completely broken in Windows 7. The new way is less elegant, but more robust.</p><p>Then, I noticed that although I didn’t think the Lock option was working, it turns out it was. I compared the locked and unlocked modes, and noticed some alignment differences in the toolbar. I traced it to a missing flag (misleadingly named “ALWAYSGRIPPER”, but apparently when it IS set, it fixes the margin, while keeping it unset, makes the margin not adapt to the absence of a gripper).</p><p>The result, at this point, looked like this:</p><p><img alt="Image" class="imgp_img" src="/sites/default/files/imagepicker/2924/Windows Server 2003-2014-05-02-13-44-45.png" height="1222" width="786"></p><p>Later, I started looking at different things. I started looking at the addressbar, then I also started researching about the internet security zones (the panel at the right of the statusbar), but I decided to leave that one for later, since it’s the least important. I looked a bit at the sidebars, but only superficially. Someone on IRC mentioned themes, so I decided to enable a theme in Windows 2003, and see how it looks. And this is the result, edited it so that both windows have the focus at the same time:</p><p><img alt="Image" class="imgp_img" src="/sites/default/files/imagepicker/2924/Win2003 Explorer filebrowser comparison.png" height="1245" width="826"></p><p>Last, a sneak preview of what’s coming this next week:</p><p><img alt="Image" class="imgp_img" src="/sites/default/files/imagepicker/2924/Windows Server 2003-2014-05-04-12-37-19.png" height="542" width="780"></p><p>Thank you and until next weekend!</p><p>Discussion: https://www.reactos.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=13285</p>
