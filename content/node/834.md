<p>The ReactOS Project is pleased to announce <b>PWCT</b> as a new participant in the Open Source Support Program.</p><p><a href="http://doublesvsoop.sourceforge.net/">Programming Without Coding Technology <i>(PWCT)</i></a> is a set of tools that tries to make GUI programming more accessible, especially for people with little programming experience.</p><p><i>PWCT</i> is focused on visual programming&nbsp; and comes with a very practical syntax editor. Its program paradigm ranges from imperative to event driven and uses tree hierarchies instead of a drag-and-drop style. The application comes with several samples and the <i>PWCT</i> project has a series of Youtube videos on its main page which helps new users become acclimated with its process.</p><p>As anyone who has ever done GUI programming can attest to, making a visual interface is not easy and tools as <i>PWCT</i> helps to make a developer's life much easier.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Image" class="imgp_img" src="/sites/default/files/imagepicker/4801/PWCT.png" height="478" width="640"></p>
