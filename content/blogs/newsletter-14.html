<h2>Another Introduction </h2>
<p>Hello, my name is Samuel Serapi&oacute;n, IRC nick: encoded. I Hail from San Juan, Puerto Rico, a 20 year old computer engineering student, I will be your ReactOS informant today. I have great hopes for this project, and this is the small part I do to help it. What will YOU do to help ReactOS!? </p>
<h2>Website Outage </h2>
<p>The day was December 14, 2006. A day which will live in infamy, well maybe not that much... What happened was that the main Raid controller of the ReactOS web Server was struck by an unknown glitch and died. Thanks to the skilled labor of our web hoster no information was lost, but www.reactos.org was off the air for 14 days. The long outage was mostly due to the time it takes to recover nearly 1TB of data from a dead raid and partly because of the holiday. We apologize for the long outage and would like to thank all the offers for web hosting we recieved, but just to make sure everyone understands, We are back! </p>
<p>Check out this <a href="http://www.reactos.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=3233">forum&nbsp;post</a>&nbsp;for more info/discussion.</p>
<h2>Meanwhile, in the SVN server... </h2>
<p>The ReactOS website was down, but the code repository was still up and fully functional, though development was slow this past weeks.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Erik Kohl was active and worked on screen savers, service manager, and other things. </li>
    <li>Magnus Olsen&nbsp;continued some work in ddraw.dll and related systems(aka. GDI), and updated dejavu font(100% Cyrillic chracter support) </li>
    <li>Maarten Bosma is developing a downloader that helps users get open source apps that are known to work on ReactOS (package manager returns!) </li>
    <li>James Tabor is working heavily on GDI compability and improvments. </li>
    <li>Johannes Anderwald is working on msvc compability and general build correctness. </li>
    <li>Christoph von Wittich is working on code correctness, fixing compiler warnings. </li>
</ul>
<h2>More News </h2>
<p>I would have liked to talk about bugs opened and closed this week... but the web site outage also took out bugzila, so maybe next week. I also would have liked to talk about ros-dev mailing list trafic, but it was also down. </p>
<p>What I can say is: </p>
<ul>
    <li>We have a new developer Sylvain Petreolle IRC nick: Usurp, CIA nick: spetreolle that has been working on unicode fixes, but has provided many patches in the past. </li>
    <li>Work continues on ReactOS Build Enviroment by Peter Ward and Christoph von Wittich, for bulding ReactOS on Windows Vista. </li>
    <li>ReactOS 0.3.1 will be released December 31, it will be based on trunk. The current 0.3.1 branch will be dropped. </li>
    <li>Klemens Friedl is working on the translation service so that translators will be able to use our website to translate ReactOS to foreign languages without mess around with RC files, almost ready for beta testing. </li>
</ul>
<p>Merry Christmas and Happy New Year! </p>
