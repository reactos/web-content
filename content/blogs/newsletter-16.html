<h2>Another 2 weeks without 0.3.1</h2>
I know you've been waiting for it(I sure have), but you certainly want a release that will boot. ReactOS will still be alpha, unstable and not recommended for everyday use. If you're really hardcore you'll try out the SVN versions. I can say that 0.3.1 will be a VERY significant improvement from 0.3.0, when we can finally get it to run on your PC.<br/>
<br/>
Also I would like to remind everyone(just in case you missed the big fundraising bar at the top of every reactos.org page) that we are raising funds, the money will go to help us maintain SVN server, web server, build servers and pay for ReactOS expositions and conferences.<br/>
<br/>
Atleast you got this great newsletter to keep you appraised of the latest developments and news from the ReactOS community, contained here is a summary of work and activity of the last 2 weeks.<br/>

<h2>More News</h2>
<ul>
    <li>New ReactOS developer, Dominic Cote, SVN nick: dcote. His first commit was on fs and cc parts of the kernel. </li>
    <li>New ReactOS developer, Dmitry G. Gorbachev, SVN nick: dgorbachev. His first commit was for Thai keyboard layout, but has several other patches to his name. </li>
    <li>Several developers are pushing for a official move from gcc 3.4.x to gcc 4.x.x as official compiler. This move has been coming for a while, the inclusion of gcc 4.1.2 in the ROSBE was a clear sign. Better code generation and stack aligment issues seem to be the primary concerns in the move. </li>
    <li>Alex Ionescu announced on the mailing list his plans to create the &quot;ReactOS Testing Environment&quot; (ROSTE) that will allow regular users to more easily test ReactOS in qemu, capture debug output, transfer files and other functions, in the hope of facilitating bug reporting and application testing. </li>
    <li>Andrew Greenwood (silverblade) has started significant work on a Windows XP compatible sound implementation. His first step was to create a simple MME driver that uses the PC speaker as a MIDI device. The purpose behind this implementation was mostly for learning the underlying APIs and setting up the stage for bigger things. It was tested as working with mplayer in Windows XP. </li>
</ul>
