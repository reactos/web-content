<h2>Busy Times</h2>
<p><font face="Verdana">It's been a hectic 3 weeks, yes I am 1 week overdue. I've been real busy with school and personal stuff, but I haven't been the only one thats been busy. It seems in my absence that 0.3.1 is finally shaping up. In this issue I will expand on the developments that have occurred not only in the main development branch (trunk), but also in the &quot;stable&quot; release branch for 0.3.1. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">I will also like to remind everyone of several important issues, which will be discussed a bit deeper later on.&nbsp;Mainly the resurection of ros-bugs mailing list and the call for testers which will help us improve and expand the usability of React as a viable Operating System. Also that the fund raising campaign is over and it was a complete success. February 08, 2007 passed and we have even more money than we setout to make. Indeed everyone at the ReactOS foundation thanks all the donators. Even so if you still desire to donate do not fret, the money will be put to good use to help promote ReactOS, aquire testing hardware and other project related costs.</font></p>
<h2><font face="Verdana">Project News</font></h2>
<ul>
    <li><font face="Verdana">ReactOS exposed at CUSEC last week by Alex Ionescu and&nbsp;as&nbsp;I type&nbsp;at SCALE, where ros devs Alex Ionescu and <font size="2">Art Yerkes</font> are talking about the amazing potential of ReactOS. </font></li>
    <li><font face="Verdana">ReactOS now compiles with GCC 4.2, RosBE 0.3.5 now only includes gcc 4.1.2, although this BE is still beta. 0.3.1 even do it compiles with 4.1.2 has not been tested enough to ensure that compiler dependant bugs are not present so gcc 3.4.5 is still recommended for it. </font></li>
    <li><font face="Verdana">Fund raising campaing is over and it is a complete success. </font></li>
    <li><font face="Verdana">The ros-bugs mailing list is back. It was down for several months after one of those server moves/difficulties we had, but now is back up and serving&nbsp;everyone with the bleeding edge issues affecting ReactOS. Making for quicker responce time to regressions and common bugs.</font> </li>
    <li>New IRC channel created #reactos-testers, specifically to discuss proper testing methodology and signup to be official tester. </li>
    <li>Possible reorganization of tree in the works, if approved many usermode apps would get transfered to ros-apps tree, a now mostly unmaintained tree with many testing and development applications. When a release is made this apps would also be included. </li>
</ul>
<h2><font face="Verdana">Events on Trunk</font></h2>
<p><font face="Verdana">The development branch shares a lot of issues with the 0.3.1 branch, but has&nbsp;severa0l important diferences.
