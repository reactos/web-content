<h2>Time to get this Newsletter Back on Track</h2>

<p>A new year, a new start, I always say. Unfortunately, I was a little bit busier over the holiday period than I had anticipated, but now that I'm back doing early shifts, instead of the late ones I was being handed, I will have enough time set aside to continue.</p>

<p>So, I'll start as I mean to go on... by Compiling! Yep, ReactOS' Source Code may be all-singing, all-dancing, bu without it being compiled, all it does it look like a pretty collection of ASCII Codes. So, without further ado, here is a tutorial for 'newbies'.</p>

<h2>Compiling on Windows</h2>

<h3>What do I need first?</h3>

<p>You first need a working copy of the ReactOS SVN source code. Now, the ReactOS Wiki lists a command-line tool for SVN, but I prefer <a href="http://tortoisesvn.sourceforge.net">TortoiseSVN</a>. Very user friendly, and capable of complicated things, like making patches, and making diffs. Mind you, this is for Windows, I'm not really experienced enough to detail compilation on Linux, BSD, or Mac OS. However, such information is present on the ReactOS Wiki for <a href="http://www.reactos.org/wiki/index.php/HOWTO/setup_a_build_environment_for_Linux/Ubuntu_v5.x">Linux</a> and <a href="http://www.reactos.org/wiki/index.php/HOWTO/setup_a_build_environment_for_FreeBSD">FreeBSD</a>. But, it should be noted, that this is designed foe Amateurs. If you're experienced enough to know how to run a copy of Linux or BSD, it's generally granted you should know how to set up a build environment. ;)</p>

<p>When Checking Out the code, the only directories you'll be really interested in reside in /trunk. The first thing you'll want to do is choose a nice, vacant space on a drive with preferably a large amount of free space. Create a Folder called 'ReactOS', and then make a subfolder called 'Trunk'. At this point, TortoiseSVN should be installed.</p>

<p>Right click on 'Trunk', and select 'Checkout', from the SVN Submenu. Input svn://svn.reactos.org/trunk as the desired location. Note that it is now .org, not .com, since the DNS Entry for reactos.com has now been removed. Now, it will begin collecting all the source code in the Trunk.</p>

<p>Now, you'll need a way to continually get updates as changes are uploaded to SVN. This comes in the form of SVN update. Again, right-click on "Trunk", and select SVN Update directly from the menu. It will then scan for changes made since the revision you have, and download them.</p>

<h3>Fine, I have the code, now can I compile it?</h3>

<p>Whoa, slow down, first you'll need a compiler. While there are many out there, the one most commonly used is the GNU C Compiler, abreviated GCC. GCC on Windows is contained in what is called the Minimalist GNU for Windows, abbreviated MinGW. You will need the following files:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://prdownloads.sf.net/mingw/MinGW-3.1.0-1.exe?download">MinGW 3.1.0-1</a></li>
<li><a href="http://prdownloads.sf.net/mingw/gcc-core-3.3.3-20040217-1.tar.gz?download">GCC Core 3.3.3</a></li>
<li><a href="http://prdownloads.sf.net/mingw/gcc-g++-3.3.3-20040217-1.tar.gz?download">GCC G++ 3.3.3</a></li>
<li><a href="http://prdownloads.sf.net/mingw/gcc-objc-3.3.3-20040217-1.tar.gz?download">GCC-Objc 3.3.3</a></li>
<li><a href="http://prdownloads.sf.net/mingw/w32api-2.5.tar.gz?download">Win32API 2.5</a></li>
<li><a href="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/mingw/binutils-2.15.94-20050118-1.tar.gz?download">binutils 2.15.94</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/devel/nasm/binaries/win32/nasm-0.98.39-win32.zip">NASM 0.98</a></li>
<li><a href="http://prdownloads.sf.net/mingw/mingw32-make-3.80.0-3.exe?download">GNU Make 3.80.0-3.exe</a></li>
<li><a href="http://prdownloads.sf.net/mingw/mingw-runtime-3.8.tar.gz?download">MinGW Runtime 3.8</a></li>
</ul>

<p>MinGW should be installed to a directory that is easily remembered, like C:gcc. All the Gzipped Tarballs should be extracted to the gcc directory, overwriting any files. The new GNU Make EXE should go in gccbin, as should the contents of the NASM Zip.</p>

<p>While you can use these versions, I've found that Win32API 3.3, Binutils 2.16.91, and GCC Core 3.4.4, GCC G++ 3.4.4, and GCC-Objc 3.4.4 can also be used. I've also included the MinGW Runtime, since unzipping that fixed a few things on my end.</p>

<p>After that, we need to do a little bit of settings editing. On Whatever Windows version you have, you need to edit the Environment Variables. These are a list of locations that Windows looks when you run a command from the command-line. (Or in Start-> Run). Under NT, 2000, XO and 2003, it can be found under System -> Advanced. Under 'Paths', add 'C:gcc;C;gccbin;' to the beginning, ignoring the apostrophies. Swap 'C' for the drive you install it on.</p>

<p>Once that's done, open up CMD, or the Command Interpreter. At the command line, switch to the directory you have the source code stored on. So, for me, it would be:</p>

<ul>
<li>S:</li>
<li>cd SVN</li>
<li>cd Reactos</li>
<li>cd Reactos</li>
</ul>


<ul>
<li>mingw32-make bootcd</li>
<li>or</li>
<li>mingw32-make livecd</li>
</ul>

<p>You can delete the old make.exe file, and rename mingw32-make.exe to make.exe to simplify the command, but it's optional if you wish to keep the old make file, for whatever twisted reason. After the compilation process, it will create an ISO Image, ready to burn. The bootcd instructs it to create a Bootable Install CD, the livecd instructs it to create a Bootable Live CD.</p>

<h2>Eye on SVN</h2>

<p>Whew. Thank God for Copy and Paste. Typing this out has made me consume around 30,000 keyboard clicks, according to my WhatPulse ticker. This is what happens when you let SVN commits pile up on you!</p>

<p>So, read, enjoy, and be amazed at what ReactOS has done in the festive period!</p>

</ul>

<h4>Fixed the following bugs/features:</h4>

<ul>
<li>ExfAcquireRundownProtection: Added specific code instead of calling the generic function. Rundown locks are performance critical and a dedicated path is prefered.</li>
<li>ExfAcquireRundownProtectionEx: Added a quick immediate check to see if the rundown is active.</li>
<li>ExfReleaseRundownProtection: Added specific code instead of calling the generic function. Rundown locks are performance critical and a dedicated path is prefered.</li>
<li>ExfReleaseRundownProtectionEx: Simplified the loop code, Fixed a bug in signaling of the event during waitblock count removal</li>
<li>ExfWaitForRundownProtectionRelease: Add quick case when we don't actually need a full wait, and Simplified loop code.</li>
<li>Added stubs for cache-aware implementation.</li>
<li>Documented the functions.</li>
<li>Fix InterlockedBitTestAndReset and InterlockedBitTestAndSet</li>
<li>Implement YieldProcessor</li>
<li>Fix formatting in spinlock.c</li>
<li>KiAcquireSpinlock and KiReleaseSpinLock should be no-op functions on uniprocessor machines.</li>
<li>KiReleaseSpinLock does not need interlocked access to release the lock.</li>
<li>Use portable code for KiAcquireSpinLock. Also use interlocked bit operations since they are faster.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Rewrite Executive Interlocked Functions to actually work as supposed and also immensly increase their speed, most notably on non-SMP machines</h4>

<ul>
<li>The functions now disable interrupts as they should. This is a core functionality of the ExInterlocked functions which we did not do.</li>
<li>The functions now preserve EFLAGS as they should. This is another core functionality and point of ExInterlocked functions, which we did not do.</li>
<li>Use KiAcquire/ReleaseSpinlock equivalents instead of going through HAL. Also make them macros which can be later used in other assembly files.</li>
<li>Write optimized versions for non-SMP machines. Namely, the spinlock macros are coded to be no-ops on UP machines, since they are not needed.</li>
<li>Write all functions in assembly, so we can cleanly optimize them and properly restore/save EFLAGS and use CLI.</li>
<li>Use the right interlocked macro in guarded mutex implementation.</li>
<li>Fix export of Exi386InterlockedExchangeUlong</li>
<li>Use documented EFLAGS definition instead of hard-coded value in some interlocked functions.</li>
<li>Cleanup assembly files and create a header for the macros added and new ones that will be added later for syscall.S & friends.</li>
<li>Implemented the 'red zone check' for the non paged pool.</li>
<li>Implement Pushlocks. Only Waking, and Exclusive Acquire/Release + Waits have been tested. The shared paths and block/unblock are still untested and may probably contain bugs. Pushlocks are not yet used in the kernel and they won't be until all paths are tested and validated.</li>
<li>Public DDIs Implemented: ExfAcquirePushLockExclusive, ExfAcquirePushLockShared, ExfTryToWakePushLock, ExfReleasePushLock, ExfReleasePushLockExclusive, ExfReleasePushLockShared, ExfUnblockPushLock.</li>
<li>Implemented Queued and In-Stack Queued Spinlocks</li>
</ul>

<h4>Fix shamefully dangerously broken Work Thread/Queue/Item implementation</h4>

</ul>
<li>Do not pollute the kernel with 10 real-time threads and 5 high-priority threads in order to manage work items. Work threads are very-low priority (< 7) and should never pre-empt userthreads like they do now. 1 priority 7, 5 priority 5 and 3 priority 4 threads are now properly created.</li>
<li>Implement a worker thread balance set manager. On SMP systems, it is able to determine when a new thread should be allocate to execute on a free CPU. On both UP and MP, it is also able to detect if a work queue has deadlocked, and will allocate new dynamic threads to unfreeze the queue.</li>
<li>Add check for threads returning with APC disabled, and re-enable APCs if this happend. This hack is used in NT for broken drivers.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Lots of code changes to support dynamic threads, which</h4>

<ul>
<li>Can terminate.</li>
<li>Use a 10 minute timeout on the kernel queue.</li>

<li>Add skeleton code for swapping worker thread stacks as well as worker thread shutdown (not yet implemented).</li>
<li>Add WORKER_INVALID bugcheck definition.</li>
<li>These changes seem to make ROS a lot more responsive.</li>
<li>New ERESOURCE implementation: fixes the return value of some functions (VOID vs NTSTATUS, USHORT vs ULONG), as well as optimized the code loops and general structure of the code. Additionnaly, functions do not simply call other functions with similar names; the exact implementation of each function has now been properly separated (see the DDK for more information on this) to have the most optimized scenarios.</li>
<li>Also, the spinlock is not actually acquired on non-SMP builds; instead, interrupts are blocked and unblocked for acquire/release, this optimizes locking.</li>
<li>Added many asserts and bugcheck scenarios.</li>
<li>Added thread priority boosting.</li>
<li>Added some debugging helpers and deadlock detection.</li>
<li>Added RESOURCE_NOT_OWNED bugcehck message.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Fix some bugs in Kernel Queue implementation</h4>

<ul>
<li>KeRemoveQueue did not set Thread->WaitNext = FALSE if it was called with WaitNext = TRUE.</li>
<li>KeRemoveQueue did not handle the case where a kernel-mode APC is pending and the previous IRQL was below APC_LEVEL.</li>
<li>KeRemoveQueue did not set the thread's wait status to 0.</li>
<li>KiInsertQueue did not set the Thread's wait status to the entry being inserted.</li>
<li>KiInsertQueue did not remove the thread from its wait list.</li>
<li>KeRemoveQueue did not properly link the wait blocks.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Shell32</h3>

<ul>
<li>Don't wait 10 seconds after starting an app via a .lnk file</li>
</ul>

<h3>SMSS</h3>

<ul>
<li>Implement system handling of page file creation sizes (Later Reverted)</li>
</ul>

<p>On FAT16 partitions smaller than 128MB, the cluster size is 2048, which is
smaller than PAGE_SIZE. This caused creation of the paging file on such a
partition to fail, which in turn made SMSS fail, blocking the boot process.
Creation of paging file fixed, and failure to create it is no longer a blocker
for the boot process (just try to run without paging file).</p>
