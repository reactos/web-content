<p>One of the main issues people trying out ReactOS have complained about is the clunkiness of the shell and how things they expect to work don't. As the shell serves as the main gateway to using the operating system, if it is hard to use then the OS itself becomes hard to use.</p><p>When talking about "interaction" we can think in two different ways of interaction: The interaction between the user and ReactOS Explorer and the interaction between applications and ReactOS Explorer(well, really the Shell).</p><p>The "Go back" button, which doesn't "Go back" at all, is a nice example of the first group.The second kind of interactions is however just as important. For example, try to drag a file from ReactOS and drop it into, let's say, Winrar in 0.3.15. In older versions of ReactOS, you'll find that you can't.</p><p>Over the past few months, Huw Campbell, a new contributor, has been working on improving the User interaction. Now thanks to his work in Shell32.dll, you'll be able to Drag files and Drop them into apps. Below you can see how 7-zip, a file compressor, is accepting files dragged in from the shell. This drag &amp; drop feature is not just limited to 7-zip, so feel free to try it with Winrar or any other app known to accept files.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Imagen" class="imgp_img" src="/sites/default/files/imagepicker/14095/DragDrop.gif" width="554" height="420"></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But Huw didn't stop there and also implemented the drag and drop support for files and folders for within the shell. As you probably know, move and copy operations should be done asynchronously, otherwise Explorer.exe would hang(waiting) until the whole copy/paste is done. So he also implemented the IAsyncOperation interface to check if the operation could be done safely in the background. This drag and drop work includes also special folders, so now you're also able to drag files directly to the Recycler Bin.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Imagen" class="imgp_img" src="/sites/default/files/imagepicker/14095/CopyMultiple.gif" width="546" height="410"></p><p>Thanks to all his work, Huw Campbell has boosted the ReactOS "usability" to a new level. Did I mention that he fixed the <a href="http://git.reactos.org/?p=reactos.git;a=commit;h=84ed163ab73045e04a7434b2c2cc74e93e5e4474" target="_blank">"copy/pasting when multiple files are selected" </a>bug? Or that he added support for <a href="http://git.reactos.org/?p=reactos.git;a=commitdiff;h=343fe82994c26d014e2280a87cb508481f62a39e;hp=862e47aad95fc4773bd9061aa93a3ed92466fee9" target="_blank">"Copy/paste through shortcuts"</a> if you don't like Drag&amp;Drop?</p><p>All these fixes and enhancements are included in the ReactOS 0.3.16 release. Try them! And dont forget to thank Huw his awesome work! Hope more is coming!</p><p><strong>You can find more info about some of his work in the following commits:</strong></p><p>-<strong><em>r61576</em></strong>:<a href="http://git.reactos.org/?p=reactos.git;a=commitdiff;h=3aac50d221b83e9f30d0dda18e4bd52dd1404d5b;hp=648f37fbb70aa693e2b65295cc2e176dd76778b9" target="_blank"> IAsyncOperation interface +&nbsp; CF_HDROP support</a></p><p>-<strong><em>r61537</em></strong>: <a href="http://git.reactos.org/?p=reactos.git;a=commitdiff;h=24397b9c45fd8c4d2c998ef00a0f06fe77d16119;hp=68c9028c15b79e767af65650f7120a44fb650a57" target="_blank">Background copy/move thread + Recycle bin drop handler</a></p><p>-<strong><em>r61294</em></strong>: <a href="http://git.reactos.org/?p=reactos.git;a=commitdiff;h=8b7037f746db5dfe03611d3609c6100243dd0e48;hp=edd3c0287000b213829655783bb2553661c71fc5" target="_blank">Initial Drag&amp;Drop support</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
