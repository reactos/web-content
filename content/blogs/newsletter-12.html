<h2>Time to get this Newsletter Back on Track</h2>
<p>A newsletter author, a new start. No, I am not the new newsletter author, we are still searching for one. Please <a href="[#link_news_page_26]"><b>read the related news entry</b></a> for more detailed information.</p>
<p>If you would like to be the ReactOS newsletter author, please<strong> send an email</strong> to <a href="http://www.reactos.org/mailman/listinfo/ros-dev" target="_blank">&quot;ros-dev&quot; developer mailing list</a> (don't forget to subscribe), explaining why you think you would be a good newsletter author.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Website update </h2>
<p>We have already update a lot of website pages and especially the &quot;info&quot; pages are still pending. One of most visible changes are on the website frontpage, which is less overloaded and the text content better worded and hopefully easier to understand. </p>
<p>Another improvement is clearly visible on the community page, the activity ticker. </p>
<h2>ReactOS status </h2>
<p>ReactOS trunk will be branched again for 0.3.1. The current 0.3.1 branch will be dropped. The main reason is that our current trunk contain a lot of improvements and is in comparision to the more matured.</p>
