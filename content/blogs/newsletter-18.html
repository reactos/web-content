<h2>Opening Words</h2>
<p>Here is another informative newsletter for your enjoyment. You may have recently noticed last issue, that some of our developers were part of community conferences and events. It&rsquo;s all part of new PR efforts to get ReactOS out there, in front of serious developers and community leaders. To raise awareness of how much ReactOS has advanced and it&rsquo;s vast potential.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m kind of wary of this issue, I&rsquo;ve been talking about 0.3.1 since the very first newsletter I wrote.&nbsp;Sometimes people ask me, like if I were responsible for the release somehow, when will it be released. I&rsquo;ve been&nbsp;assured by our release engineer that there are only 2 blocking issues left and that it will be released soon. That said, a kind user compiled the 0.3.1 branch and provided the isos&nbsp;for public trials <a href="http://reactos.colinfinck.de/">here</a> .</p>
<p>I also spoke with our project leader about future releases and he went on to say that future releases (0.3.2, 0.3.3, 0.3.x&hellip;) will be made every month or 2. Furthermore that at this moment in time ReactOS releases may in fact have LESS success in running Windows&reg; apps and drivers, but in the long run it will be far better and far more compatible with Windows&reg;. Current issues are just growing pains. Note, I&rsquo;m just paraphrasing and results may vary ;-) </p>
<h2>Project News </h2>
<div><font face="Verdana">- Aleksey Bragin gave a talk about ReactOS at the FOSDEM conference in Brussels, video is available <a href="http://ftp.belnet.be/mirror/FOSDEM/2007/FOSDEM2007-ReactOS.ogg">here</a>.</font></div>
<div><font face="Verdana">- Alex Ionescu gave a talk about ReactOS to the students and professors at the University of Waterloo, Canada.</font></div>
<div>- Alex Ionescu also managed to connect ReactOS to windbg(Windows Debugger), this work is currently in a branch. Windbg is widely used by many driver developers and Microsoft itself to test and well.. debug Windows&reg; and it's drivers. This is expected to accelerate development and bug fixing in the future.</div>
<div><font face="Verdana">- Christel is still looking for more testers and invites everyone willing and able to drop by #reactos-testers channel on the freenode IRC network.</font></div>
