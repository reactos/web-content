<h2>On the status of 0.3.1</h2>
Many of you have asked about 0.3.1 since it was clearly promised for the time frame of late December-early January. There have been many queries about it in the chat rooms and forums. Well, the problem is actually rather simple. The developers have decided that releases should be made every month, or at an appropriate time where in trunk or a designated branch is reasonably usable and showcases the progress of the ReactOS project.<br/>
<br/>
Currently the main development branch "trunk" even though it has many new features and bug fixes since 0.3.0, it currently has several issues that prevent it from being relatively useful. Furthermore functionality that once worked no longer does, this is called a regression. Until trunk has been reasonably fixed 0.3.1 will not be released. Be assured that the developers are working hard on fixing the current issues and bringing forth a good public release as soon as humanly possible.<br/>
