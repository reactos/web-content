<h2>A New Volume</h2>
When Samuel took over the newsletter, there was no guideline as to what constituted a Volume.&nbsp; After talking to him, we decided to mark Volumes by year.&nbsp; This means that Volume 1 had nine issues from 2005, Volume 2 had five issues from 2006, and Volume 3 has eight issues and counting in 2007.&nbsp; And now we continue the biweekly rotation of who writes the meat of the article.&nbsp; Samuel will continue to provide the statistics from SVN and bugzilla though.<br/>
<h2>Minor and Major Developments<br/>
</h2>
<p>Not much has actually happened within the last two weeks.&nbsp; Aleksey Bragin is on vacation and the plan is to branch 0.3.2 after his return.&nbsp; Magnus Olsen has been cleaning up DX headers and updating them as he finds them on his harddrive.&nbsp; He had suffered a crash and is trying to avoid losing any of the actual data.&nbsp; The only news item of major longterm significance would be the new documentation system being set up by Timo Kreuzer.&nbsp; Known as Physicus on IRC and ThePhysicist on the forums, he has been working on the code for it for quite some time.&nbsp; A simple preview and test was available on his website, but they were only of two minor pieces of code and formatting issues existed.&nbsp; The importance of this system cannot be overestimated.&nbsp; ReactOS' weakest point is still the state of its documentation.&nbsp; While one could look at the code, trying to figure out the relationships between various files, data structures, and functions can get very difficult.&nbsp; Kreuzer's system would help alleviate much of this issue and make it easier for newcomers to understand what the code is doing.&nbsp; Kreuzer recently ran a test of the system on the entire tree.&nbsp; After some more tweaking and formatting corrections, it will be usable by the general public.&nbsp; I personally have been asking for such a system for a long time, but the limited development resources worked against its creation.&nbsp; This tool is another important addition to ReactOS' infrastructure so be sure to congratulate him once it goes live.</p>
