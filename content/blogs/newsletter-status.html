<p>Hi Folks, TwoTailedFox here, just giving you guys the rundown on what's happenning with the Newsletter.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I was busier than I'd intended to be over Christmas and New Years. Being given lots of long shifts bunched together is a sure-fire way for me to feel very, very tired.</p>

<p>Newsletter contents for Issue 10 have been finalised, and I've jotted down every relevent SVN update since the 13th of December. All that needs to be done is add lots of pretty formatting, and pray it's flawless first time around.</p>

<p>Oh, and RSS Feeds have been working for a while, so all you need to do it point your preferred RSS Reader to http://www.reactos.org/xhtml/en/newsfeed_rss.xml to get the at-a-glance feeling of seeing if we have any new News or Newsletter Items.</p>

<p>So, bear with me, and the Newsletter will be here shortly. And if not, feel free to track me down via Email and bug me 'till it's finished ;)</p>
