<p>If you have been following the weekly reports, you know that I have been having issues with the focus manager.</p><p>Well, this week I redesigned part of the focus manager, improving the structure so that it has more accurate information of what’s happening with the menus. While improving the code, I also fixed some bugs in the code.</p><p>By Wednesday, I had what appeared to be working code. While running it in Windows 7, everything seemed to work, both in the start menu and the menu bar. But then after commiting (for backup purposes), I copied the files over to win2003, and when I ran it there, I noticed a bug. After moving the cursor to one of the menu items that didn’t open a submenu, moving to another item in the menubar would cause the menu to close without opening the other menu!</p><p>I spent some time trying to analyse what could be different between Windows 2003 and Windows 7, and then it turns out it also happens in Win7, except since the Favorites menu has more items, I had never hovered the lower items. It was then that I noticed another bug: the Favorites menu, like the start menu, has two toolbars: One with static items, and one with dynamic (shell folder) items.</p><p>The week was not a waste, though. I *have* been fixing bugs, the code *has* been improving, it’s just that the bugs I fixed are not the bugs I was aiming for.</p><p>This would be the face I was making when I was trying to figure out the bug… if I was a cat:</p><p><img alt="" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9e/Green_eyes_kitten.jpg/871px-Green_eyes_kitten.jpg" height="640" width="726"></p><p>In case anyone wonders whatthe title is about, quoting wikipedia:</p><p>"In Greek mythology Sisyphus (/ˈsɪsɪfəs/; Greek: Σίσυφος, Sísyphos) was a king of Ephyra (now known as Corinth) punished for chronic deceitfulness by being compelled to roll an immense boulder up a hill, only to watch it roll back down, and to repeat this action forever."</p><p>Discussion: https://www.reactos.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=13177</p>
