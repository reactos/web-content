Hello Everyone !!
Until week 2 we made API calls to the Branches and Commits Endpoint of the GitHub API and rendered it. So at the end of week 2, we were able to fetch Top 5 commits from any of the branches as required.
<h3>Week 3</h3>
<ul><li>UI Improvement</li></ul>
Till week 2 we just had a simple table showing a few very basic information about the commits. So we designed a collapsible Panel which can contain all information required from the API.

{{< figure link="/sites/default/files/imagepicker/56126/ros1.png" >}}

At first, the panel shows some basic commit information and upon clicking the panel you get all details.

Now, Just 5 Commits isn't sufficient So we made it 10 and added a <b>Next</b> and <b>Previous</b> button as well.
<h3>Week 4</h3>
In week 4, We made an API call to the Pull Request Endpoint and similarly designed to match with the Commits tab. After that, we added the State-based filter to get the required PR and <b>Next</b> and <b>Previous</b> button as well. 

Thanks for Reading :)
