<p>Going into week 5, I started with a code-complete but very much incorrect implementation of the TDI_SEND and TDI_RECEIVE IRQ handlers. My TCP_CONTEXT data structure and the existing ADDRESS_FILE data structure both did not contain a way to keep track of pending IRQs, so I had no way of keeping track of outstanding pending IRQs and what connection contexts they were supposed to be associated with. Without a clear scheme for keeping track of the information, IRP pointers invariably got lost. As a result, when trying to handle requests resulting from valid Winsock API calls, my driver leaked memory and left hanging pending IRQs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To really address this issue, which resulted from my lack of familiarity with Windows driver programming and the TCP protocol in general, I had to come up with a scheme of how to keep track of all the IRQs my driver receives along with which lwIP protocol control block (PCB) they are associated with.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My first attempt at solving the problem was creating another struct, the TCP_REQUEST, to link IRPs with their associated lwIP PCBs and general purpose address files. Each address file would contain a list of contexts as before, but each context would keep a list of requests it's pending on. As I tried to properly implement this scheme of keeping track of information, I ran into more and more problems with how to tell what state each address file and connection context was in. Every time I fixed one problem, another one seemed to pop up. If I wasn't freeing memory at an improper time, I was failing the correct pointers or overwriting pointers to outstanding requests. As the week dragged on and I continue to be stuck on the same problem of how to keep track of IRQs and their associated addresses, I finally decided to do two things. First, I would add state variables to the address files, the contexts, or both structs. Second, I would draw an actual state diagram before proceeding further.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the week's close, I am still in the process of drawing the state diagram. I hope this is the last large structural change I will need to make to my code to make it functionally correct, if still not feature-complete or entirely robust.&nbsp;</p>
