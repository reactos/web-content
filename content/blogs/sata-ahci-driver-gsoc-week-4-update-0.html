This week I worked on AHCI IO Request Processing and FIS programming part. I implemented IO Queue, Slot distribution mechanism for AHCI requests. Updated Github's PR for next round of code review.<br>Next I will be working on port programming i.e. telling the controller about the slots that I've allotted for IO request.<br>
Very soon we will have a running AHCI device driver :D<br>
I also added a notes.txt file which actually tracks my progress for every routine/support <a href="https://svn.reactos.org/svn/reactos/branches/GSoC_2016/AHCI/drivers/storage/storahci/Notes.txt?revision=71655&view=markup">link</a><br>
I was completely new to NT driver development when I started this project. But now I learned a lot, All thanks to ReactOS developers community and my mentor (Alex), Every one wants to help you went you hit a problem. This is the best thing I have experienced.<br>
