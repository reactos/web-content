<p>This is a summary of all the work that has been completed this summer on the file search project.</p>
<p>All contributed code can be found in this <a href="https://github.com/reactos/reactos/pull/1869" target="_blank">GitHub pull request</a>.</p>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Here is a list of the main features:
<li>Quickly open it from the Start menu or with the keyboard shortcut <code>Windows + F</code></li>
<li>Search is case-insensitive and recurses all sub-folders</li>
<li>Support for UTF-16 encoded text files</li>
<li>File name filtering with support for wildcards</li>
<li>"In Folder" column shows the folder each file is located in</li>
<li>Right-click menu includes "Open Containing Folder" option</li>
<li>Progress is indicated in the status bar at the bottom of the window</li>
</p>

<h3>Future Improvements</h3>
<p>One additional feature that might improve this tool is the ability to toggle case-sensitivity. Adding a checkbox to the UI for enabling case-sensitive search wouldn't be very difficult to do and the search functionality was previously case-sensitive before I decided to make it consistent with Windows. Another idea is to support searching with regular expressions. There is already a regular expression engine in the ReactOS codebase for VBScript and JScript, so it may be possible to reuse it or add a different engine such as PCRE.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>This summer was a great opportunity for me to learn more about Windows application development. I would like to thank my mentors Giannis and David for all of their guidance and support. I really enjoyed working on this project and hope it will be useful to the ReactOS community.</p>
