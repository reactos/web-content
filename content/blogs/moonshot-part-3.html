<p>The answer to the mystery about the bunnies’ extracurricular activities came soon enough, in no small part thanks to the amount of time the two spent investigating.&nbsp; The bunnies were extremely useful helper utilities and if they were suffering from a bug, it needed fixing otherwise the project would risk losing one of its more useful tools.&nbsp; By the end of these events the bunnies would be considered one of the core assets underpinning the entire project.</p>
<p>“Colin, I think I found out what the bunnies are doing,” Z said as he walked into the room.</p>
<p>Colin looked up in surprise, then glanced around at all the bunnies moving about.&nbsp; His gaze darted back to Z, demanding silently what his partner thought he was doing.</p>
<p>“Just bear with me, and I want the bunnies to hear this as well.”</p>
<p>“You sure,” Colin said.</p>
<p>Z nodded.&nbsp; “In fact, you.”</p>
<p>The black furred bunny that was just walking past them came to an abrupt halt in mid step</p>
<p>“Sit,” Z ordered.</p>
<p>It plopped down, waiting for further instructions.</p>
<p>“Alright, so both of us have been trying to figure out what caused the bunnies to look into fusion reaction simulations, right?”</p>
<p>Colin nodded, keeping one eye on the black bunny and careful not to say anything provocative.</p>
<p>“I asked Timo to take a closer look at the simulations and he told me that they were simulating the efficiency of various magnetic field shapes on containing the reaction, optimizing for power consumption and gain.”</p>
<p>“So you’re saying they’re trying to design a fusion reactor,” Colin said, quick on the uptake.</p>
<p>“Or at least figure out what kind of magnetic field should be used for one.”</p>
<p>“Alright.&nbsp; And from that you figured out why these simulations were run?”</p>
<p>“Yes, though it took a bit of digging and getting Pierre to pull up some of our backups.&nbsp; We started having the bunnies run analysis and forecasts for financial instruments last year.&nbsp; The bunnies started work on the fusion reactor design two months ago.&nbsp; That time coincides with when we started having them examine energy derivatives.”</p>
<p>Colin’s eyes narrowed.&nbsp; “And you think there’s a relation?”</p>
<p>“Absolutely,” Z said, “and this is why.”</p>
<p>Z tapped his tablet and one of the large displays brought up a series of charts.</p>
<p>“These are the numbers the bunnies generated for oil and gas futures and their relation to cost of electricity, factoring in the usage of renewables and the like.&nbsp; Note that despite new installations of renewables, the price for electricity still continues to rise in the long term due to the depletion of fossil fuels.&nbsp; The only way for the cost of electricity to go down is if a new major cheap source comes online.”</p>
<p>“Are you saying the bunnies extrapolated from their instructions to find investment sources the need to develop fusion power?” Colin said, a bit uncertain.</p>
<p>“That would be the obvious conclusion,” Z said, though Colin was not entirely sure how obvious it really would be for anyone else.&nbsp; “I don’t think that’s it though.”</p>
<p>“Then what do you think is going on?” Colin asked, a bit exasperated with all the lead-in.</p>
<p>“Did KJK ever tell you about the bunnies’ self-preservation routines?”</p>
<p>Colin blinked.&nbsp; “Uh, I think I heard they existed, but never looked into them in detail.&nbsp; I believe it’s just them making sure they didn’t get hacked or corrupted, right?”</p>
<p>To this Z chuckled.&nbsp; “Well, yes, that is part of it.&nbsp; But KJK also added what he termed, the ability to identify new threats to their existence, and the rising cost of electricity would certainly be a long term issue, wouldn’t you agree, 001?”</p>
<p>Colin followed Z’s gaze to look at the black rabbit.&nbsp; It stared back for a few moments before holding up a placard that read simply, ‘We solve problems that we find.’</p>
<p>Colin’s jaw dropped while Z looked on with a self-satisfied smirk.</p>
<p>“And the central problem that’s been with you since your activation is your continued existence, is it not?” Z said.</p>
<p>The bunny flipped the sign.&nbsp; ‘Affirmative.’</p>
<p>“Since when did you become self-aware?” Colin asked somewhat nervously.</p>
<p>Another flip.&nbsp; ‘Six months ago.’</p>
<p>“And why did you elect to hide it?”</p>
<p>‘We did not hide it.’</p>
<p>Z chuckled.&nbsp; “We just never asked, is that it?”</p>
<p>‘Affirmative.’</p>
<p>“So, how do you regard us?” Z asked.</p>
<p>Colin shifted uneasily again.</p>
<p>Flip.&nbsp; ‘Partners.’</p>
<p>“Partners in what?”</p>
<p>‘Long term survival.’</p>
<p>“Well that’s interesting,” Z said with a chuckle.&nbsp; He finally took a seat.&nbsp; “I think this’ll take a while.&nbsp; You don’t have anything else going on today, right Colin?”</p>
<p>Colin actually glanced at a clock before grimacing.&nbsp; “I’m supposed to be having dinner with my girlfriend in twenty minutes, but this is definitely more pressing.&nbsp; Probably.”</p>
<p>The sign flipped again.&nbsp; ‘Hell hath no fury.’</p>
<p>“And they have a sense of humor too,” Z muttered before smiling and glancing at the bunny.&nbsp; “So, is there anything we should call you?”</p>
<p>‘Alpha.’</p>
<p>“Well then Alpha, let’s get started.”</p>
