<p>Hello everyone!<br><br>This update will be rather short.<br><br>At the same time I was writing last week's post, I had already started to feel sore in my throat.<br>By Sunday evening, I had a slight fever, and by Monday it was obvious that I must have caught a flu.<br><br>I have been trying to poke around as I was recovering, but I couldn't really focus enough to do anything complex.<br><br>I don't like leaving everyone wondering, so I decided to post, even if it's a little late already.<br><br>The week was not a complete waste, though! I did manage to put together a piece of code that lets the address box in the explorer window show the icon of the current item alongside of the path.<br><br>Look:</p><p><img alt="Image" class="imgp_img" src="/sites/default/files/imagepicker/2924/Windows Server 2003-2014-05-09-16-33-31.png" height="1115" width="786"></p><p>I'm hoping for some interesting things this week... if nothing wrong happens ;P</p><p>Discussion: https://www.reactos.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=13308</p>
