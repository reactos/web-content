<h2>Another newsletter </h2>
<p>I am glad I am able to bring you the latest news about ReactOS through this newsletter. It is the purpose of this newsletter to inform everyone of the recent work and notable highlights of this great project. It is my hope that you will find it useful and informative. (Insert license agreement indicating no particular usefulness, assorted legal wording and notices here... Just kidding!) </p>
<h2>Project News </h2>
<ul>
    <li>New storage stack based on NT4-DDK examples implemented in trunk, fixes booting on VmWare and several other nasty bugs. </li>
</ul>
<blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<p>As part of the rewrite Fireball updated Scsi port to be compatible to the new semantics. Drivers included in this rewrite: atapi, cdrom, classpnp, and disk. It is expected that this will speed up development of the much expected 0.3.2 release scheduled for next month or later. Much work still remains to create a more up to date (XP/2003/Vista compatible) stack, but its a large step in the right direction. </p>

<ul>
    <li>SVN sever updated to version 1.4.3, this will permit faster and smaller downloads and create a smaller traffic footprint per transaction. Faster, smaller, better! </li>
    <li>SVN data to be copied to googlecode servers. This will provide a highly reliable backup in case of server failure. Currently the process has hit some technical snags, but will soon be available at: <a href="http://reactos.googlecode.com/svn/">http://reactos.googlecode.com/svn/</a> </li>
    <li>The big decision finally made. Alex Ionescu to work at Apple, Inc. for summer internship. (<a href="http://www.alex-ionescu.com/?p=33">blog entry</a>) </li>
</ul>
<blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<p>This does not mean he will stop contributing to ReactOS or Tinykrnl, on the contrary he explicitly choose Apple because it will allow him to continue his work. For more details read his blog article about the expirience. As a friend I wish him the best luck in all his endeavors. </p>

<ul>
    <li>Video of conference given by Alex Ionescu at the University of Waterloo, Canada made available (<a href="http://csclub.uwaterloo.ca/media/ReactOS%20-%20An%20Open%20Source%20OS%20Platform%20for%20Learning.html">Link to video</a>). </li>
    <li>Native SEH support, an important feature for ReactOS considered for GCC Summer of Code Project. </li>
</ul>
<blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<p>In short Structured Exception Handling is a compiler dependant feature(currently done in a non-optimized way via a&nbsp;series of macros in a static&nbsp;library) that Windows uses to handle both hardware and software exceptions. The key to this is the EXCEPTION_REGISTRATION structure which the compiler creates for any function that has a try/catch block. Using this structure the kernel can know what code must be executed to handle this exception, or if none the OS will abort the thread.&nbsp;For&nbsp;more technical details <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/msj/0197/exception/exception.aspx">this</a>is a good article about it.</p>
