<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Hey Everyone, I'm Ayush Kumar Sinha, A 2nd Year CS undergraduate from VIT Vellore, India and a GSoC student this year under ReactOS : )</p>
<h3>How I got to know about the project </h3>
<p>While scrolling through the list of accepted Orgs of 2018 (with filters like web, C++, javascript)I bumped into ReactOS. Hey!! they are building Windows-like OS from scratch, Sounds cool :). But the project ideas look quite hard with my existing C/C++ skills. But wait they have something for the web as well and that deals with GitHub API (I think I found a project )  </p>
<h3>Before the Application period</h3>
<p>I explored Testman and Buildbot, got to know about its working and got a clear Idea about the Project. Ok, let's write a good Proposal  </p>
<h2>The Community Bonding Period</h2>
<p>@colin-finck, @vicmarcal and @extravert34 are my mentors : D </p>
<p>In this period I learnt ReactJs, Redux and Redux-saga and their best practices which were essential to get started with the project. @smiley 's doc of what the developer Interface should look like made me more clear about the expectation of the community about this project ... Let's start Coding </p>
<h2>Week 1 </h2>
The task before the First evaluation is to fetch and render Commits and pull request.<br>
In the first week, <ul><li>made an API call to Commits endpoint</li><li>configured react-app to make use of Redux</li><li>Designed the header component with Reactstrap and boostrap</li></ul>
<h2>Week 2 </h2>
This week is going on and I have made Good progress this week ( I think so !! ). All thanks to the self coding I did in the community bonding period. <br>
In the Second week, <ul><li>made an API call to branches endpoint</li><li>Rendered the latest commits and all branches to the client side </li><li>Deployed the Application on Heroku <a href="https://developer-interface-ros.herokuapp.com/">here</a></li></ul>
Now the Application shows you the 5 latest commits from master(by default). Upon clicking a particular branch, you can get the latest commits of that particular branch.
Hope I am Going on a good pace XD
Thanks for Reading : )
