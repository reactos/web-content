<h2>Welcome To Reality</h2>

<p>Welcome to the ReactOS Weekly Newsletter, Issue 8, where there are three kinds of people, none of them particularly effective at writing a newsletter today.</p>

<h2>The Delay: Excuses Inbound</h2>

<p>Unfortunately, Issue 8 was delayed last week, because Mrs. Flu decided to bed me over, and screw me crosseyed, leaving me very ill, and making my body wish it had a built-in thermostat. Anyway, it's better to have a newsletter late, than not at all, so let's just jump straight to it.</p>

<h2>New Release: 0.2.9</h2>

<p>Yup, we have another release planned for you all. 0.2.9 is our lastest release thus far, to assist our preperations for 0.3.0, and to give you an insight into what's changed since 0.2.8.</p>

<p>Release Candidate 1 is up on <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=6553">Sourceforge</a></p>

<h2>New Networking Code?</h2>

<p>Yes, and no. It's in a branch all its own, under the care of Alex Ionescu, submitted for archival purposes, and so he could claim the must-coveted 20000 Commit Number. Must of it doesn't link or compile properly, so hopefully it'll be worked on in time for 0.3.0.</p>

<h2>Eye on SVN</h2>

<p>Two weeks, and a bumper log to peruse over. As always, minor bugs are skipped, and from next week, I'll squeeze in app Translations under a new secions.</p>

<h2>20,000 Commits!</h2>

<p>Yes, The ReactOS Project has now reached 20,000 CVS/SVN commits, which, for a project this size, in a few years, really is quite incredible. You Developers feel up to breaking 100,000 Commits? ;)</p>

<h2>What's up for Next Week?</h2>
<p>Next week, I'll be seeing if I can come up with a better tagline for the newsletter. Oh, and I'll also be delving into the Wiki, and pulling up just how far along to ReactOS 1.0 we are. I was hoping to do it this week, but everyone has their own opinion on what goes in what version, and what version constitutes "Alpha" and "Beta" Status. I need clarification, folks.</p>
<p>Until Next Week.. Happy Compiling!</p>
