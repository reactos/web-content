<h2>I'm the new guy(s)</h2>
<p>Yup, that's right, we're the new newsletter writers (those two words should never be used in combination - I promise never to do it again). We fought off a crowd of people breaking their necks to apply, and finally, we're here. So. Who are we? I am Dana Burkart, I will do most of the writing, and my associate - Samuel Serapion - will be providing most of the information. I just want to say that I vow never to turn this newsletter into a carnival. Shall we get on with it? </p>
<h2>A whole lotta change</h2>
<p>It has been a long time since ReactOS has had a writer for the Newsletter. As such, there are a lot of things that need to be covered, and, conversely, many things that must be passed over. Therefore, Samuel Serapion and I have planned to make this a big first newsletter. We are trying to cover most of the changes to the trunk since v0.3 of ReactOS, with a little recap on recent changes and what various developers are working on. We are trying to make this as comprehensible as possible, so it can be useful and informational to the casual ReactOS user. Let it be noted that most newsletters won't be this long; we're just trying to make up for missed ground.</p>
<h2>Recent News</h2>
<ul><li>A new release process has been proposed, and will likely be accepted. The idea: ReactOS will release on a strict and regular schedule. This will have some advantages and disadvantages:
<ul><li>For the casual user who doesn't build ReactOS themselves, this will provide a more up-to-date and realistic view of the project. </li>
<li>In the long run, this will increase ReactOS's popularity, as people will see this is a far-from-dead project. </li>
<li>More developers will be attracted to ReactOS because of how active it is. </li>
<li>In the near future, release quality may suffer. </li>
</ul></li>
<li>You can now build ReactOS on Vista; RosBE has been updated to allow this. </li>
