<p>Not so long ago trying to run a whole office suite was almost a dream. Just launching an app was a success.There was just one complex suite almost working: "SoftMaker Office 2008". A nice, and mostly unknown, Microsoft Office clone. It was such a good Office clone that it is closed and non-free.</p>
<p>From past experience you can find two kind of users out there: "Pro-open source" users asking for LibreOffice and OpenOffice support, and "Pro-Office" users asking for Microsoft Office.&nbsp; Well, there is a third kind which wants everything running on ReactOS: "Alike-Me" users.</p>
<p>Step by step, improvement by improvement, and bug by bug, ReactOS is now able to run <strong>Microsoft Office 2003</strong> in a decent state.</p>
<p>This video, created by <strong>Yaroslaw Denisov</strong>, shows how Office 2003 works on ReactOS.</p>

<p>Obviously, there is a lot of work to be done like polishing the visual glitches, discovering potential hangs,and so on,but being able to run a complex app is a nice step forward.</p>
<p>But Yaroslaw wasn't the first one to discover that Office 2003 works in ReactOS. Seems <strong>GTASАnek</strong> was really the first one. At that time Office 2003 was running, but the usability was not as good as it is nowadays.</p>

<p><br>Maybe it's time to begin checking newer MS Office versions. Great and special thanks to <strong>Yaroslaw Denisov and </strong><strong>GTASАnek</strong> because their testing time.</p>
<p><span style="font-size:14px;"><strong>Who knows what other surprises are still hidden in ReactOS?</strong></span></p>
