<h2>Compilation fixes for MacOS X</h2>
<p>
Recently some developers have managed to compile ReactOS in OS X. So if you have built mingw32 for your mac and would like to build ReactOS in your mac you can. The primary difficulties lay in some wchar defines and iswdigit function and where fixed relatively easily. 
</p>
<h2>Win32k</h2>
<p>
The all important graphical subsystem continues its march to becoming the fully featured, safe and performing beast it should be. Important work is going into shared structures, parameter validation, matching windows syscalls and usermode gdi components. Jimtabor, Greatlord and Timo are all working hard to rewrite win32k. This will be the cornerstone for support for even more games and applications. 
</p>
<h2>Object Manager</h2>
<p>
Recently a series of critical bugs where discovered in Ob, some have already been fixed by Art Yerkes. Ob handles all sorts of objects, of interest recently are handles. Each process has a table of handles that it has opened; this table is maintained solely by Ob and is not accessible to programs. Apparently on process close 1 or more handles are leaked, this problem then leads to further corruption, which in turn causes BSODs. This issue will be fixed as soon as possible.

<h2>WS2_32</h2>
<p>
As of r28419 ReactOS now has the set of async winsock DNS functions, thanks to Art Yerkes and wine. These functions allow some programs to resolve names among other things. This fixes a few bugs with domain name resolution, notably mirc not being able to resolve server names<span style="font-family: Wingdings"><span>J</span></span>. 
</p>
<h2>Russian Website Translations</h2>
<p>
Andrey Korotaev is actively working to update the Russian ReactOS website. Translation is a very important part of Open Source communities, promoting ourselves on different languages and maintaining everyone informed and up to date on latest news. This way everyone can participate. If you would like to translate the website or ReactOS itself please step forward!
