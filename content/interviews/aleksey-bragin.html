<h2>Aleksey Bragin</h2><p><em>Interview with Aleksey Bragin by Klemens Friedl</em></p><p>Aleksey Bragin, born in Moscow, Russia in 1983 been involved with ReactOS since year 2002 and contributed to a lot of different parts throughout the project since that time.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h3>Start</h3><h4>How did you get involved with ReactOS?</h4><p>Lots of time ago an idea came to my mind, the idea was creating a FOSS alternative to Windows. However, I was too busy with the projects I was doing (mostly in game development area) and thus did not really search for already existing projects of this kind.<br />Things changed in 2002, when I finally decided to start a project to slowly substitute components of MS Windows by FOSS ones, but before starting my own project I always perform some investigation of what is already available. Fortunately, I found a small reference to ReactOS project, along with FreeWin95 and some other OS-projects (I already knew Wine though long before &ndash; in fact I tried to compile and run back in 1998 when I bought some linux-cd with the Wine on it too). When I examined all projects, I found out that ReactOS project had the biggest potential of becoming a mature FOSS Windows-compatible operating system, and thus I decided to abandon my personal project and join ReactOS instead.</p><h4>So up until the point you had been programming for Windows?</h4><p>Yes, that&rsquo;s true. I was a 3d game developer, and mainly I had to develop for Windows platform. I had Linux programming experience too, but it was lots smaller than what I knew about Windows, Win32 API, OpenGL, DirectX etc. Then I switched into kernel mode programming (writing drivers for Windows NT, researching NT kernel architecture). This finally lead me to ReactOS project.</p><h4>Do you remember the first work you did on ReactOS?</h4><p>I remember it very good, because this first work is still in use today. It was the &ldquo;console task manager&rdquo; I did especially for ReactOS, when it didn&rsquo;t have any GUI, but it needed a way to view and kill processes. Originally this application was called Text-Mode Task Manager (tmtm) but later I decided to rename it to &ldquo;ctm&rdquo; since it sounds better. Some ReactOS devs and testers prefer to use this tool now too, even despite we have a GUI taskmgr.exe.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h3>Fun with ReactOS</h3><h4>What&rsquo;s your favorite area of ReactOS to work on?</h4><p>I like every part of ReactOS, there is no part which I wouldn&rsquo;t want to work on. However, I usually pick the most interesting and/or important parts where I posess enough knowledge to implement/fix a certain feature or parts which don&rsquo;t get enough attention from other developers. Also, sometimes I like to switch from one area to another completely different area (like from bootloader to fixing some CPL applet) &ndash; it gives some fresh feeling and lets you better focus on real problems.</p><h3>Meetings</h3><h4>What&rsquo;s been the favorite place you&rsquo;ve visited?</h4><p>I&rsquo;d like to name two events I&rsquo;m glad I visited. They are &ndash; LinuxWorld 2004 in Frankfurt where I first met in person other ReactOS developers &ndash; Steven Edwards, Ge van Geldorp, Hyperion, Eric Kohl, Emanuele Aliberti and other, it was a great time I spent with that people. Also LinuxTag 2005 in Karlsruhe was quite fun too, thanks to Xbox-Linux project. Despite ReactOS was late to officially claim a booth at LinuxTag2005, people from Xbox-Linux were kind enough to offer me half of their own booth to demo ReactOS, also they helped me with almost everything I needed &ndash; computer peripheral for demo system, printing information sheets, banners, etc. So it was equally great and fun to spend the time with the Xbox-Linux team.</p><h3>Work</h3><h4>What kind of development environment do you use?</h4><p>I tried really a lot of various IDEs and text editors, but I came to a solution which I use nowadays: I prefer MS Visual Studio when I need something bigger, and just pure FAR&rsquo;s internal editor when I need to hack in a specific file or search through a lot of files for some string.</p><h4>So, beside ReactOS is there any other projects you&rsquo;re involved in, and what you like to do in your spare time, if you have any?</h4><p>Yes, definitely my life doesn&rsquo;t consist only from ReactOS, but making ReactOS a success is my main goal - it is the project I believe in.<br />In my free time I like to&nbsp;do some healthy things like sports and&nbsp;travelling. Summer time better suits activities like swimming and table tennis playing outside on a fresh air, and during winter I prefer to go skiing - but not mountain skiing (yet :)).</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
