The German ING-DiBa AG bank is running a competition which people have until November 15th to vote on which foundation they support.  The top 1000 foundations will receive a 1000€ donation from the bank.  At the time of writing the ReactOS Foundation is sitting at 9th place, but three weeks is a long time for other projects to catch up and perhaps even bump ReactOS from the top 1000.  Instructions for how to vote are located <a href="http://reactos.org/pipermail/ros-dev/2011-October/014928.html">here</a> and requires only an email.  Each email can also vote three times.  The project would thus like to ask the community members to lend us their strength in numbers to ensure the ReactOS Foundation wins the funding, and perhaps even become #1, which would be a big boon for publicity.
