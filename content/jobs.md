The ReactOS Project is seeking qualified individuals to fill multiple positions. Contracted **full time, part time, and scholarship (internship)** level positions are all available.

If you qualify for a position, you'll be joining the very small and exclusive ranks of people who know how to do NT systems development. And believe us, those ranks are very, very small so you will be gaining an immense amount of knowledge working with such people. It's a great way for beginners to interact with people who have been working in this field for over the years.

Available Positions

Developer
---
We are looking for people proficient in C and its a big plus if you are proficient in C++ too.C++ proficiency does not equate C proficiency so do not assume you have the latter if you have the former. Also keep in mind, again, that these are the minimum requirements. On top of these you need to be a good problem solver, belief in the mission of ReactOS, and most importantly, be able to demonstrate that you can work with the ReactOS codebase via a few patches.

In ReactOS, we need all kinds of people: those who are ready to port drivers and/or work mainly in the kernel region, those who would like to work in different other things such as Shell, Explorer and Win32 API. If you would like to have a detailed look at what we do, you can refer to our [page](/developing) which explains it all in detail. For all the work related to kernel and drivers, you need to be proficient in C. But when it comes to user-mode, you do need to have knowledge of / experience with C++. As an example, most of the applications are written in C++ not in C. Whereas when the drivers / kernel mode components are mainly written in C.

For more information on the C++ part, you can have a look at [Win32 development using C++](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/LearnWin32/learn-to-program-for-windows).

For those of you interested, you can have a look at our wiki page which pretty much covers all of the details on getting started with development for ReactOS.

[Development Introduction](https://reactos.org/wiki/Development_Introduction)

Every year we participate in [Google Summer of code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) which is a program by Google which lets you work with us during the summer to work on a major project. Google pays the student, and ReactOS provides guidance / assistance in the form of a mentor. 

We even conduct hackfests every year where our team comes together and sit together to fix issues.


Tester
---
No operating system is usable if it is found to be unstable and prone to crashes. As ReactOS development work involves studying the behavior of an operating system that is not completely documented, testing is of even greater importance in order to fulfill the objective of binary compatibility with Windows.

You can assist the ReactOS development effort by installing regular nightly (master) builds available [here](https://reactos.org/getbuilds/) and providing feedback on issues/problems you encountered during and after installing the OS via our [bug tracker](https://jira.reactos.org/). More information with regard to debugging is available [here](https://reactos.org/wiki/Debugging) and is recommended reading for those who wish to submit a report to our bug tracker. For this, you need to have basic knowledge in collecting information from a crash like backtraces and crash dumps. Knowledge of using a basic debugger is a plus.

We have wiki pages for setting up a debugging environment and building using different compilers too.

Jira maintainer
---
We use JIRA to keep track of issues. This position is for people interested in maintaining JIRA. You will have to look after the development/work progress in the bugtracker and assist in triaging the issues. This includes but is not limited to: Asking for the exact version that was tested, disseminating logs (or asking further steps to provide those), labeling issues. Currently, we have a system that links each of the PR from GitHub to the related issue in JIRA. In this role, you will mainly be working to make sure everything in JIRA works as expected.

Content editor / creator

We are a small team of individuals working, so we need some creative people to look after the posts(content to be posted in our blog) and our site. In this role, you will need to write articles, make changes or update the wiki pages. This could be adding new information or images. You will mainly be working on this site and the wiki pages. Our current site is generated using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). New design ideas are welcome too.
