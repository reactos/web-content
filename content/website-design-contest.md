<p>
The task is to create a mockup for a new homepage and menu layout. We want a fresh layout, as the current one is starting to show its age.
<ul>
  <li>color scheme should be compatible with the ReactOS logo and the logo included into the design.
  <li>it should contain a diagram for a simplified frontpage
  <li>it should also integrate stylistically with the forum, wiki & bugzilla
  <li>it should render consistently across IE7+, FF2+, Opera 9+, Safari 3+ and without javascript or other browser plugins, though javascript and DOM may be used for optional effects whose absence will not adversely degrade the usability of the site
  <li>there is no guarantee that your proposal will not be modified if selected
  <li>any submission must be of an original work by the submitter/submitters (you are free to use the ReactOS logo for the proposal)
  <li>submitters grants the ReactOS Foundation a royalty-free license to use and/or modify their respective designs, though all submitters retain the rights to their work
</ul>
</p>
<p>
The best submission will be selected by a jury of five (Aleksey Bragin, Colin Finck, Danny Götte, Ged Murphy and Ziliang Guo).
</p>
<p>
